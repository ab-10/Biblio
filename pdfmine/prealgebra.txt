About Prealgebra 2e
Prealgebra 2e is designed to meet scope and sequence requirements for a one-semester prealgebra course. The text
introduces the fundamental concepts of algebra while addressing the needs of students with diverse backgrounds and
learning styles. Each topic builds upon previously developed material to demonstrate the cohesiveness and structure of
mathematics.
Students who are taking basic mathematics and prealgebra classes in college present a unique set of challenges. Many
students in these classes have been unsuccessful in their prior math classes. They may think they know some math, but
their core knowledge is full of holes. Furthermore, these students need to learn much more than the course content. They
need to learn study skills, time management, and how to deal with math anxiety. Some students lack basic reading and
arithmetic skills. The organization of Prealgebra makes it easy to adapt the book to suit a variety of course syllabi.

Coverage and Scope
Prealgebra 2e takes a student-support approach in its presentation of the content. The beginning, in particular, is
presented as a sequence of small steps so that students gain confidence in their ability to succeed in the course. The order
of topics was carefully planned to emphasize the logical progression throughout the course and to facilitate a thorough
understanding of each concept. As new ideas are presented, they are explicitly related to previous topics.
Chapter 1: Whole Numbers
Each of the four basic operations with whole numbers—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—is
modeled and explained. As each operation is covered, discussions of algebraic notation and operation signs,
translation of algebraic expressions into word phrases, and the use the operation in applications are included.

2

Preface

Chapter 2: The Language of Algebra
Mathematical vocabulary as it applies to the whole numbers is presented. The use of variables, which
distinguishes algebra from arithmetic, is introduced early in the chapter, and the development of and practice
with arithmetic concepts use variables as well as numeric expressions. In addition, the difference between
expressions and equations is discussed, word problems are introduced, and the process for solving one-step
equations is modeled.
Chapter 3: Integers
While introducing the basic operations with negative numbers, students continue to practice simplifying,
evaluating, and translating algebraic expressions. The Division Property of Equality is introduced and used to solve
one-step equations.
Chapter 4: Fractions
Fraction circles and bars are used to help make fractions real and to develop operations on them. Students
continue simplifying and evaluating algebraic expressions with fractions, and learn to use the Multiplication
Property of Equality to solve equations involving fractions.
Chapter 5: Decimals
Basic operations with decimals are presented, as well as methods for converting fractions to decimals and vice
versa. Averages and probability, unit rates and unit prices, and square roots are included to provide opportunities
to use and round decimals.
Chapter 6: Percents
Conversions among percents, fractions, and decimals are explored. Applications of percent include calculating
sales tax, commission, and simple interest. Proportions and solving percent equations as proportions are
addressed as well.
Chapter 7: The Properties of Real Numbers
The properties of real numbers are introduced and applied as a culmination of the work done thus far, and to
prepare students for the upcoming chapters on equations, polynomials, and graphing.
Chapter 8: Solving Linear Equations
A gradual build-up to solving multi-step equations is presented. Problems involve solving equations with
constants on both sides, variables on both sides, variables and constants on both sides, and fraction and decimal
coefficients.
Chapter 9: Math Models and Geometry
The chapter begins with opportunities to solve “traditional” number, coin, and mixture problems. Geometry
sections cover the properties of triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, circles, irregular figures, the Pythagorean
Theorem, and volumes and surface areas of solids. Distance-rate-time problems and formulas are included as
well.
Chapter 10: Polynomials
Adding and subtracting polynomials is presented as an extension of prior work on combining like terms. Integer
exponents are defined and then applied to scientific notation. The chapter concludes with a brief introduction to
factoring polynomials.
Chapter 11: Graphs
This chapter is placed last so that all of the algebra with one variable is completed before working with linear
equations in two variables. Examples progress from plotting points to graphing lines by making a table of
solutions to an equation. Properties of vertical and horizontal lines and intercepts are included. Graphing linear
equations at the end of the course gives students a good opportunity to review evaluating expressions and solving
equations.
All chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the Table of Contents.

Changes to the Second Edition
The Prealgebra 2e revision focused on mathematical clarity and accuracy. Every Example, Try-It, Section Exercise, Review
Exercise, and Practice Test item was reviewed by multiple faculty experts, and then verified by authors. This intensive
effort resulted in hundreds of changes to the text, problem language, answers, instructor solutions, and graphics.
However, OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by shifting problem and exercise numbers when
textbooks are revised. In an effort to make the transition to the 2nd edition as seamless as possible, we have minimized
any shifting of exercise numbers. For example, instead of deleting or adding problems where necessary, we replaced
problems in order to keep the numbering intact. As a result, in nearly all chapters, there will be no shifting of exercise
numbers; in the chapters where shifting does occur, it will be minor. Faculty and course coordinators should be able to
use the new edition in a straightforward manner.
Also, to increase convenience, answers to the Be Prepared Exercises will now appear in the regular solutions manuals,
rather than as a separate resource.
A detailed transition guide is available as an instructor resource at openstax.org.

Pedagogical Foundation and Features
Learning Objectives
Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives.
The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section and are the focal point of every instructional
element.

Narrative text
Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide
transitions between topics and examples. An informal voice was used to make the content accessible to students.
Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas:
Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined.
Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.

Examples
Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples, which demonstrate the problem-solving
approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple Examples for each learning objective in order to
model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity.
All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the
Solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select Examples), we show students how to check the solution.
Most examples are written in a two-column format, with explanation on the left and math on the right to mimic the way
that instructors “talk through” examples as they write on the board in class.

Figures
Prealgebra 2e contains many figures and illustrations. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style,
drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions.

Supporting Features
Four small but important features serve to support Examples:
Be Prepared!
Each section, beginning with Section 1.2, starts with a few “Be Prepared!” exercises so that students can determine if
they have mastered the prerequisite skills for the section. Reference is made to specific Examples from previous sections
so students who need further review can easily find explanations. Answers to these exercises can be found in the
supplemental resources that accompany this title.
How To

Example.

A “How To” is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A "How To" typically precedes an

Try It

A “Try It” exercise immediately follows an Example, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to
solve a similar problem. In the PDF and the Web View version of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the
Answer Key.
Media

The “Media” icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a
list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section.
Disclaimer: While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these

4

Preface

tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany Prealgebra 2e.

Section Exercises
Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used
selectively for guided practice. Exercise sets are named Practice Makes Perfect to encourage completion of homework
assignments.
Exercises correlate to the learning objectives. This facilitates assignment of personalized study plans based on
individual student needs.
Exercises are carefully sequenced to promote building of skills.
Values for constants and coefficients were chosen to practice and reinforce arithmetic facts.
Even and odd-numbered exercises are paired.
Exercises parallel and extend the text examples and use the same instructions as the examples to help students
easily recognize the connection.
Applications are drawn from many everyday experiences, as well as those traditionally found in college math texts.
Everyday Math highlights practical situations using the math concepts from that particular section.
Writing Exercises are included in every Exercise Set to encourage conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and
literacy.

Chapter Review Features
The end of each chapter includes a review of the most important takeaways, as well as additional practice problems that
students can use to prepare for exams.
Key Terms provides a formal definition for each bold-faced term in the chapter.
Key Concepts summarizes the most important ideas introduced in each section, linking back to the relevant
Example(s) in case students need to review.
Chapter Review Exercises includes practice problems that recall the most important concepts from each section.
Practice Test includes additional problems assessing the most important learning objectives from the chapter.
Answer Key includes the answers to all Try It exercises and every other exercise from the Section Exercises,
Chapter Review Exercises, and Practice Test.

Introduction
Even though counting is first taught at a young age, mastering mathematics, which is the study of numbers, requires
constant attention. If it has been a while since you have studied math, it can be helpful to review basic topics. In
this chapter, we will focus on numbers used for counting as well as four arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. We will also discuss some vocabulary that we will use throughout this book.
1.1

Introduction to Whole Numbers

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Identify counting numbers and whole numbers
Model whole numbers
Identify the place value of a digit
Use place value to name whole numbers
Use place value to write whole numbers
Round whole numbers

Identify Counting Numbers and Whole Numbers
Learning algebra is similar to learning a language. You start with a basic vocabulary and then add to it as you go along.
You need to practice often until the vocabulary becomes easy to you. The more you use the vocabulary, the more familiar
it becomes.
Algebra uses numbers and symbols to represent words and ideas. Let’s look at the numbers first. The most basic numbers
used in algebra are those we use to count objects: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, … and so on. These are called the counting numbers.
The notation “…” is called an ellipsis, which is another way to show “and so on”, or that the pattern continues endlessly.
Counting numbers are also called natural numbers.

8

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers

MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity Number Line-Part 1 will help you develop a better understanding of the
counting numbers and the whole numbers.

Counting Numbers
The counting numbers start with

1 and continue.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5…

Counting numbers and whole numbers can be visualized on a number line as shown in Figure 1.2.

Figure 1.2 The numbers on the number line increase from left to right, and decrease from right to
left.

The point labeled 0 is called the origin. The points are equally spaced to the right of 0 and labeled with the counting
numbers. When a number is paired with a point, it is called the coordinate of the point.
The discovery of the number zero was a big step in the history of mathematics. Including zero with the counting numbers
gives a new set of numbers called the whole numbers.
Whole Numbers
The whole numbers are the counting numbers and zero.

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5…
We stopped at 5 when listing the first few counting numbers and whole numbers. We could have written more numbers
if they were needed to make the patterns clear.
EXAMPLE 1.1
Which of the following are ⓐ counting numbers? ⓑ whole numbers?

0, 1 , 3, 5.2, 15, 105
4
Solution

ⓐ The counting numbers start at 1,

so

0 is not a counting number. The numbers 3, 15, and 105 are all counting

numbers.

ⓑ Whole numbers are counting numbers and 0.
The numbers

The numbers

0, 3, 15, and 105 are whole numbers.

1 and 5.2 are neither counting numbers nor whole numbers. We will discuss these numbers later.

Model Whole Numbers
Our number system is called a place value system because the value of a digit depends on its position, or place, in a
number. The number 537 has a different value than the number 735. Even though they use the same digits, their value
is different because of the different placement of the

3 and the 7 and the 5.

Money gives us a familiar model of place value. Suppose a wallet contains three

$100 bills, seven $10 bills, and four $1

bills. The amounts are summarized in Figure 1.3. How much money is in the wallet?

Figure 1.3

Find the total value of each kind of bill, and then add to find the total. The wallet contains

$374.

Base-10 blocks provide another way to model place value, as shown in Figure 1.4. The blocks can be used to represent
hundreds, tens, and ones. Notice that the tens rod is made up of 10 ones, and the hundreds square is made of 10 tens,
or

100 ones.

Figure 1.4

Figure 1.5 shows the number

138 modeled with base-10 blocks.

Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity “Model Whole Numbers” will help you develop a better understanding
of place value of whole numbers.

Identify the Place Value of a Digit
By looking at money and base-10 blocks, we saw that each place in a number has a different value. A place value chart
is a useful way to summarize this information. The place values are separated into groups of three, called periods. The
periods are ones, thousands, millions, billions, trillions, and so on. In a written number, commas separate the periods.
Just as with the base-10 blocks, where the value of the tens rod is ten times the value of the ones block and the value of
the hundreds square is ten times the tens rod, the value of each place in the place-value chart is ten times the value of the
place to the right of it.
Figure 1.6 shows how the number

5,278,194 is written in a place value chart.

Use Place Value to Name Whole Numbers
When you write a check, you write out the number in words as well as in digits. To write a number in words, write the
number in each period followed by the name of the period without the ‘s’ at the end. Start with the digit at the left, which
has the largest place value. The commas separate the periods, so wherever there is a comma in the number, write a
comma between the words. The ones period, which has the smallest place value, is not named.

37,519,248 is written thirty-seven million, five hundred nineteen thousand, two hundred forty-eight.

Notice that the word and is not used when naming a whole number.

HOW TO : : NAME A WHOLE NUMBER IN WORDS.
Step 1.

Starting at the digit on the left, name the number in each period, followed by the period name.
Do not include the period name for the ones.

Step 2.

Use commas in the number to separate the periods.

EXAMPLE 1.4
Name the number

Use Place Value to Write Whole Numbers
We will now reverse the process and write a number given in words as digits.

HOW TO : : USE PLACE VALUE TO WRITE A WHOLE NUMBER.
Step 1.

Identify the words that indicate periods. (Remember the ones period is never named.)

Step 2.

Draw three blanks to indicate the number of places needed in each period. Separate the
periods by commas.

Step 3.

Name the number in each period and place the digits in the correct place value position.

EXAMPLE 1.6
Write the following numbers using digits.

ⓐ fifty-three million, four hundred one thousand, seven hundred forty-two
ⓑ nine billion, two hundred forty-six million, seventy-three thousand, one hundred eighty-nine
Solution

ⓐ Identify the words that indicate periods.
Except for the first period, all other periods must have three places. Draw three blanks to indicate the number of places
needed in each period. Separate the periods by commas.
Then write the digits in each period.

Put the numbers together, including the commas. The number is

53,401,742.

ⓑ Identify the words that indicate periods.

needed in each period. Separate the periods by commas.
Then write the digits in each period.

The number is

9,246,073,189.

Notice that in part ⓑ, a zero was needed as a place-holder in the hundred thousands place. Be sure to write zeros as
needed to make sure that each period, except possibly the first, has three places.

Round Whole Numbers
2013, the U.S. Census Bureau reported the population of the state of New York as 19,651,127 people. It might be
enough to say that the population is approximately 20 million. The word approximately means that 20 million is not the

exact population, but is close to the exact value.

The process of approximating a number is called rounding. Numbers are rounded to a specific place value depending
on how much accuracy is needed. 20 million was achieved by rounding to the millions place. Had we rounded to the

19,700,000 as a result. Had we rounded to the ten thousands place, we
19,650,000 as a result, and so on. The place value to which we round to depends on how we need to use the

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers

number.
Using the number line can help you visualize and understand the rounding process. Look at the number line in Figure
1.7. Suppose we want to round the number 76 to the nearest ten. Is 76 closer to 70 or 80 on the number line?

Figure 1.7 We can see that

Now consider the number

Figure 1.8 We can see that

How do we round

76

is closer to

80

than to

70.

So

76

rounded to the nearest ten is

80.

72. Find 72 in Figure 1.8.

70,

so

rounded to the nearest ten is

70.

75 to the nearest ten. Find 75 in Figure 1.9.

Figure 1.9 The number

75

is exactly midway between

70

and

80.

So that everyone rounds the same way in cases like this, mathematicians have agreed to round to the higher number,
80. So, 75 rounded to the nearest ten is 80.
Now that we have looked at this process on the number line, we can introduce a more general procedure. To round a
number to a specific place, look at the number to the right of that place. If the number is less than 5, round down. If it
is greater than or equal to
So, for example, to round

5, round up.

76 to the nearest ten, we look at the digit in the ones place.

6. Because 6 is greater than or equal to 5, we increase the digit in the tens place by
7 in the tens place becomes an 8. Now, replace any digits to the right of the 8 with zeros. So, 76 rounds to

EXAMPLE 1.8
Round

843 to the nearest ten.

Solution

Locate the tens place.
Underline the digit to the right of the tens place.
Since 3 is less than 5, do not change the digit in the tens
place.
Replace all digits to the right of the tens place with zeros.
Rounding 843 to the nearest ten gives

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers

Solution

ⓐ
Locate the hundreds place.
The digit of the right of the hundreds place is 5. Underline the digit to the right
of the hundreds place.

Since 5 is greater than or equal to 5, round up by adding 1 to the digit in the
hundreds place. Then replace all digits to the right of the hundreds place with
zeros.
So 23,658 rounded to
the nearest hundred is
23,700.

ⓑ
Locate the hundreds place.
Underline the digit to the right of the hundreds place.

The digit to the right of the hundreds place is 7. Since 7 is
greater than or equal to 5, round up by added 1 to the 9. Then
place all digits to the right of the hundreds place with zeros.
So 3,978 rounded to the nearest
hundred is 4,000.

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers

19

Solution

ⓐ
Locate the thousands place. Underline the digit to the right of the
thousands place.
The digit to the right of the thousands place is 0. Since 0 is less than 5,
we do not change the digit in the thousands place.

We then replace all digits to the right of the thousands pace with zeros.

So 147,032 rounded to the
nearest thousand is 147,000.

ⓑ
Locate the thousands place.
Underline the digit to the right of the thousands place.

The digit to the right of the thousands place is 5. Since 5 is
greater than or equal to 5, round up by adding 1 to the 9. Then
replace all digits to the right of the thousands place with zeros.
So 29,504 rounded to the nearest
thousand is 30,000.
Notice that in part

Table 1.1

Did you notice what happens when you add zero to a number? The sum of any number and zero is the number itself. We
call this the Identity Property of Addition. Zero is called the additive identity.
Identity Property of Addition
The sum of any number

a and 0 is the number.

28

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers

a+0=a
0+a=a
EXAMPLE 1.15
Find each sum:

ⓐ 0 + 11

ⓑ 42 + 0

Solution

ⓐ The first addend is zero. The sum of any number and zero is the number.

0 + 11 = 11

ⓑ The second addend is zero. The sum of any number and zero is the number.

42 + 0 = 42

TRY IT : : 1.29

Find each sum:

ⓐ 0 + 19

ⓑ 39 + 0

Find each sum:

ⓑ 57 + 0

Look at the pairs of sums.

2+3=5

3+2=5

4 + 7 = 11

7 + 4 = 11

8 + 9 = 17

9 + 8 = 17

Notice that when the order of the addends is reversed, the sum does not change. This property is called the Commutative
Property of Addition, which states that changing the order of the addends does not change their sum.
Commutative Property of Addition
Changing the order of the addends

a and b does not change their sum.
a+b=b+a

Did you notice that changing the order of the addends did not change their sum? We could have immediately known the
sum from part ⓑ just by recognizing that the addends were the same as in part ⓑ, but in the reverse order. As a result,
both sums are the same.

10. But what happens if the
10 or more? Let’s use our base-10 model to find out. Figure 1.10 shows the addition of 17 and 26 again.

In the previous example, the sum of the ones and the sum of the tens were both less than

Figure 1.10

When we add the ones,

the tens place.

7 + 6, we get 13 ones. Because we have more than 10 ones, we can exchange 10 of the ones
4 tens and 3 ones. Without using the model, we show this as a small red 1 above the digits in
9, we carry over to the next column to the left. Carrying is the
10 ones for 1 ten or 10 tens for 1 hundred.

When the sum in a place value column is greater than

that gives the information to find it. Next we translate the word phrase into math notation and then simplify. Finally, we
write a sentence to answer the question.

Use Subtraction Notation
Suppose there are seven bananas in a bowl. Elana uses three of them to make a smoothie. How many bananas are left
in the bowl? To answer the question, we subtract three from seven. When we subtract, we take one number away from
another to find the difference. The notation we use to subtract 3 from 7 is

7−3
We read

7 − 3 as seven minus three and the result is the difference of seven and three.

Model Subtraction of Whole Numbers
A model can help us visualize the process of subtraction much as it did with addition. Again, we will use base-10 blocks.
Remember a block represents 1 and a rod represents 10. Let’s start by modeling the subtraction expression we just
considered, 7 − 3.

We start by modeling the first number, 7.

Now take away the second number, 3. We'll circle 3 blocks to show that we are
taking them away.

Count the number of blocks remaining.
We have shown that
7−3 = 4.

There are 4 ones blocks left.

MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity Model Subtraction of Whole Numbers will help you develop a better
understanding of subtracting whole numbers.

EXAMPLE 1.27
Model the subtraction:

8 − 2.

Solution
8 − 2 means the difference of 8 and 2.
Model the first, 8.
Take away the second number, 2.
Count the number of blocks remaining.
We have shown that 8 − 2 = 6 .

There are 6 ones blocks left.

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers

Solution
Model the first number, 13. We use 1 ten and 3 ones.
Take away the second number, 8. However, there are not 8 ones,
so we will exchange the 1 ten for 10 ones.

Now we can take away 8 ones.

Count the blocks remaining.
We have shown that 13 − 8 = 5 .

There are five ones left.

As we did with addition, we can describe the models as ones blocks and tens rods, or we can simply say ones and tens.

Solution
Because 43 − 26 means 43 take away 26, we begin by modeling the 43.

Now, we need to take away
exchange

1 ten for 10 ones.

Now we can take away

26, which is 2 tens and 6 ones. We cannot take away 6 ones from 3 ones. So, we

Subtract Whole Numbers
Addition and subtraction are inverse operations. Addition undoes subtraction, and subtraction undoes addition.
We know 7 − 3 = 4 because 4 + 3 = 7. Knowing all the addition number facts will help with subtraction. Then we can
check subtraction by adding. In the examples above, our subtractions can be checked by addition.

7−3=4

because

4+3=7

13 − 8 = 5

because

5 + 8 = 13

43 − 26 = 17

because

To subtract numbers with more than one digit, it is usually easier to write the numbers vertically in columns just as we did
for addition. Align the digits by place value, and then subtract each column starting with the ones and then working to
the left.

Solution
Write the numbers so each place value lines up vertically.
Subtract the ones. We cannot subtract 6 from 3, so we borrow 1 ten. This makes 3 tens and 13
ones. We write these numbers above each place and cross out the original digits.

Now we can subtract the ones. 13 − 6 = 7. We write the 7 in the ones place in the difference.

Now we subtract the tens. 3 − 2 = 1. We write the 1 in the tens place in the difference.

Write the numbers so each place value lines up vertically.
Subtract the ones. 7 − 4 = 3.
Write the 3 in the ones place in the difference. Write the 3 in the ones place in the difference.
Subtract the tens. We cannot subtract 6 from 0 so we borrow 1 hundred and add 10 tens to
the 0 tens we had. This makes a total of 10 tens. We write 10 above the tens place and cross
out the 0. Then we cross out the 2 in the hundreds place and write 1 above it.

Now we subtract the tens. 10 − 6 = 4. We write the 4 in the tens place in the difference.

Finally, subtract the hundreds. There is no digit in the hundreds place in the bottom number
so we can imagine a 0 in that place. Since 1 − 0 = 1, we write 1 in the hundreds place in the
difference.

Solution
Write the numbers so each place value lines up vertically.
Subtract the ones. We cannot subtract 6 from 0, so we borrow 1 ten and add 10 ones to the
10 ones we had. This makes 10 ones. We write a 0 above the tens place and cross out the 1.
We write the 10 above the ones place and cross out the 0. Now we can subtract the ones.

10 − 6 = 4.

Write the 4 in the ones place of the difference.

Subtract the tens. We cannot subtract 8 from 0, so we borrow 1 hundred and add 10 tens to
the 0 tens we had, which gives us 10 tens. Write 8 above the hundreds place and cross out
the 9. Write 10 above the tens place.

Now we can subtract the tens. 10 − 8 = 2 .

Subtract the hundreds place. 8 − 5 = 3 Write the 3 in the hundreds place in the difference.

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers

Solution
Write the numbers so each place values line up vertically.
Subtract the ones. Since we cannot subtract 9 from 2, borrow 1 ten and add 10 ones to the 2
ones to make 12 ones. Write 5 above the tens place and cross out the 6. Write 12 above the
ones place and cross out the 2.

12 − 9 = 3

Now we can subtract the ones.

Write 3 in the ones place in the difference.

Subtract the tens. Since we cannot subtract 7 from 5, borrow 1 hundred and add 10 tens to
the 5 tens to make 15 tens. Write 0 above the hundreds place and cross out the 1. Write 15
above the tens place.

15 − 7 = 8

Now we can subtract the tens.

Write 8 in the tens place in the difference.

Now we can subtract the hundreds.

Write 6 in the hundreds place in the difference.

Subtract the thousands. There is no digit in the thousands place of the bottom number, so
we imagine a 0. 1 − 0 = 1. Write 1 in the thousands place of the difference.

Model Multiplication of Whole Numbers
There are many ways to model multiplication. Unlike in the previous sections where we used base-10 blocks, here we will
use counters to help us understand the meaning of multiplication. A counter is any object that can be used for counting.
We will use round blue counters.
EXAMPLE 1.40
Model:

3 × 8.

Solution
To model the product

The other factor is

3 × 8, we’ll start with a row of 8 counters.

3, so we’ll make 3 rows of 8 counters.

Now we can count the result. There are

24 counters in all.

3 × 8 = 24

does not change the sum. We saw that 8 + 9 = 17 is the same as 9 + 8 = 17.
Is this also true for multiplication? Let’s look at a few pairs of factors.

When we multiply by a number with two or more digits, we multiply by each of the digits separately, working from right
to left. Each separate product of the digits is called a partial product. When we write partial products, we must make sure
to line up the place values.

HOW TO : : MULTIPLY TWO WHOLE NUMBERS TO FIND THE PRODUCT.
Step 1.

Write the numbers so each place value lines up vertically.

Step 2.

Multiply the digits in each place value.
◦ Work from right to left, starting with the ones place in the bottom number.
▪ Multiply the bottom number by the ones digit in the top number, then by the
tens digit, and so on.
▪ If a product in a place value is more than

9, carry to the next place value.

▪ Write the partial products, lining up the digits in the place values with the
numbers above.
◦ Repeat for the tens place in the bottom number, the hundreds place, and so on.
◦ Insert a zero as a placeholder with each additional partial product.
Step 3.

EXAMPLE 1.46
Multiply:

62(87).

Add the partial products.

62

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers

Solution
Write the numbers so each place lines up vertically.
Start by multiplying 7 by 62. Multiply 7 by the digit in the ones place of 62. 7 ⋅ 2 = 14. Write the 4
in the ones place of the product and carry the 1 to the tens place.

Multiply 7 by the digit in the tens place of 62. 7 ⋅ 6 = 42. Add the 1 ten we carried. 42 + 1 = 43 .
Write the 3 in the tens place of the product and the 4 in the hundreds place.
The first partial product is 434.
Now, write a 0 under the 4 in the ones place of the next partial product as a placeholder since we
now multiply the digit in the tens place of 87 by 62. Multiply 8 by the digit in the ones place of 62.
8 ⋅ 2 = 16. Write the 6 in the next place of the product, which is the tens place. Carry the 1 to the
tens place.

Multiply 8 by 6, the digit in the tens place of 62, then add the 1 ten we carried to get 49. Write the 9
in the hundreds place of the product and the 4 in the thousands place.

The second partial product is 4960. Add the partial products.

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers

Solution
There should be

Notice that the second partial product of all zeros doesn’t really affect the result. We can place a zero as a placeholder in
the tens place and then proceed directly to multiplying by the 2 in the hundreds place, as shown.

If we want to know the size of a wall that needs to be painted or a floor that needs to be carpeted, we will need to find
its area. The area is a measure of the amount of surface that is covered by the shape. Area is measured in square units.
We often use square inches, square feet, square centimeters, or square miles to measure area. A square centimeter is a
square that is one centimeter (cm.) on a side. A square inch is a square that is one inch on each side, and so on.

For a rectangular figure, the area is the product of the length and the width. Figure 1.12 shows a rectangular rug with a
length of 2 feet and a width of 3 feet. Each square is 1 foot wide by 1 foot long, or 1 square foot. The rug is made of

6 squares. The area of the rug is 6 square feet.

product of its length and its width, or 6

4 cookies in each bag. How many bags would we need?

So far we have explored addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Now let’s consider division. Suppose you have the
cookies in Figure 1.13 and want to package them in bags with

Figure 1.13

4 cookies in first bag, 4 in the second bag, and so on until you run out of cookies. Doing it this way, you
3 bags.

You might put
would fill

In other words, starting with the 12 cookies, you would take away, or subtract, 4 cookies at a time. Division is a way to
represent repeated subtraction just as multiplication represents repeated addition.
Instead of subtracting

4 repeatedly, we can write
12 ÷ 4

12 and 4. The quotient is 3 because we can
4 from 12 exactly 3 times. We call the number being divided the dividend and the number dividing it the
divisor. In this case, the dividend is 12 and the divisor is 4.
We read this as twelve divided by four and the result is the quotient of
subtract

Model Division of Whole Numbers
As we did with multiplication, we will model division using counters. The operation of division helps us organize items into
equal groups as we start with the number of items in the dividend and subtract the number in the divisor repeatedly.
MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity Model Division of Whole Numbers will help you develop a better
understanding of dividing whole numbers.

Divide Whole Numbers
We said that addition and subtraction are inverse operations because one undoes the other. Similarly, division is the
inverse operation of multiplication. We know 12 ÷ 4 = 3 because 3 · 4 = 12. Knowing all the multiplication number
facts is very important when doing division.
We check our answer to division by multiplying the quotient by the divisor to determine if it equals the dividend. In
Example 1.57, we know 24 ÷ 8 = 3 is correct because 3 · 8 = 24.

Dividing any number

(except 0) by itself produces a quotient of 1. Also, any number divided by 1 produces a quotient

of the number. These two ideas are stated in the Division Properties of One.
Division Properties of One

Any number (except 0) divided by itself is one.

$0, and want to divide it among 3 people. How much would each person get? Each person would get
$0. Zero divided by any number is 0.

Suppose we have

$10 by 0. That means we would want to find a number that we multiply by 0 to
get 10. This cannot happen because 0 times any number is 0. Division by zero is said to be undefined.
Now suppose that we want to divide

These two ideas make up the Division Properties of Zero.

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers

Division Properties of Zero

Zero divided by any number is 0.

0÷a=0

Dividing a number by zero is undefined.

a ÷ 0 undefined

Table 1.7

Another way to explain why division by zero is undefined is to remember that division is really repeated subtraction. How
many times can we take away 0 from 10 ? Because subtracting 0 will never change the total, we will never get an
answer. So we cannot divide a number by

0.

Divide the first digit of the dividend, 7, by the divisor, 3.
The divisor 3 can go into 7 two times since 2×3 = 6 . Write the 2 above the 7 in the quotient.

Multiply the 2 in the quotient by 3 and write the product, 6, under the 7.

Subtract that product from the first digit in the dividend. Subtract 7 − 6 . Write the difference,
1, under the first digit in the dividend.

Bring down the next digit of the dividend. Bring down the 8.

Divide 18 by the divisor, 3. The divisor 3 goes into 18 six times.

Write 6 in the quotient above the 8.

Multiply the 6 in the quotient by the divisor and write the product, 18, under the dividend.
Subtract 18 from 18.

We would repeat the process until there are no more digits in the dividend to bring down. In this problem, there are no
more digits to bring down, so the division is finished.

EXAMPLE 1.61
Divide

2,596 ÷ 4. Check by multiplying:

Solution
Let's rewrite the problem to set it up for long division.
Divide the first digit of the dividend, 2, by the divisor, 4.
Since 4 does not go into 2, we use the first two digits of the dividend and divide 25 by 4. The
divisor 4 goes into 25 six times.
We write the 6 in the quotient above the 5.
Multiply the 6 in the quotient by the divisor 4 and write the product, 24, under the first two
digits in the dividend.
Subtract that product from the first two digits in the dividend. Subtract 25 − 24 . Write the
difference, 1, under the second digit in the dividend.

Now bring down the 9 and repeat these steps. There are 4 fours in 19. Write the 4 over the 9.
Multiply the 4 by 4 and subtract this product from 19.

Bring down the 6 and repeat these steps. There are 9 fours in 36. Write the 9 over the 6.
Multiply the 9 by 4 and subtract this product from 36.

So 2,596 ÷ 4 = 649 .

Since that won't work, we try 6 into 45.
There are 7 sixes in 45. We write the 7 over the 5.
Multiply the 7 by 6 and subtract this product from 45.

Now bring down the 0 and repeat these steps. There are 5 sixes in 30.
Write the 5 over the 0. Multiply the 5 by 6 and subtract this product from 30.

Now bring down the 6 and repeat these steps. There is 1 six in 6.
Write the 1 over the 6. Multiply 1 by 6 and subtract this product from 6.

Multiply the 8 by 9 and subtract this product from 72.

Now bring down the 6 and repeat these steps. There are 0 nines in 6.
Write the 0 over the 6. Multiply the 0 by 9 and subtract this product from 6.

Now bring down the 3 and repeat these steps. There are 7 nines in 63. Write the 7 over the 3.

Solution
Let's rewrite the problem to set it up for long division.
First we try to divide 4 into 1. Since that won't work, we try 4 into 14.
There are 3 fours in 14. We write the 3 over the 4.
Multiply the 3 by 4 and subtract this product from 14.

Now bring down the 3 and repeat these steps. There are 5 fours in 23.
Write the 5 over the 3. Multiply the 5 by 4 and subtract this product from 23.

Now bring down the 9 and repeat these steps. There are 9 fours in 39.
Write the 9 over the 9. Multiply the 9 by 4 and subtract this product from 39.
There are no more numbers to bring down, so we are done.
The remainder is 3.

Check by multiplying.

So

1,439 ÷ 4 is 359 with a remainder of 3. Our answer is correct.

There is 1 thirteen in 14. We write the 1 over the 4.
Multiply the 1 by 13 and subtract this product from 14.

Now bring down the 6 and repeat these steps. There is 1 thirteen in 16.
Write the 1 over the 6. Multiply the 1 by 13 and subtract this product from 16.

Now bring down the 1 and repeat these steps. There are 2 thirteens in 31.
Write the 2 over the 1. Multiply the 2 by 13 and subtract this product from 31. There

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers

85

Solution
241 74,521

Let's rewrite the problem to set it up for long division.
First we try to divide 241 into 7. Since that won’t work, we try 241 into 74. That still
won’t work, so we try 241 into 745. Since 2 divides into 7 three times, we try 3.
Since 3×241 = 723 , we write the 3 over the 5 in 745.
Note that 4 would be too large because 4×241 = 964 , which is greater than 745.
Multiply the 3 by 241 and subtract this product from 745.

Now bring down the 2 and repeat these steps. 241 does not divide into 222.
We write a 0 over the 2 as a placeholder and then continue.

Now bring down the 1 and repeat these steps. Try 9. Since 9×241 = 2,169 ,
we write the 9 over the 1. Multiply the 9 by 241 and subtract this product from
2,221.
There are no more numbers to bring down, so we are finished. The remainder is 52.
So 74,521 ÷ 241
is 309 with a remainder of 52.
Check by multiplying.

Sometimes it might not be obvious how many times the divisor goes into digits of the dividend. We will have to guess and
check numbers to find the greatest number that goes into the digits without exceeding them.

KEY TERMS
coordinate A number paired with a point on a number line is called the coordinate of the point.
counting numbers The counting numbers are the numbers 1, 2, 3, ….
difference The difference is the result of subtracting two or more numbers.
dividend When dividing two numbers, the dividend is the number being divided.
divisor When dividing two numbers, the divisor is the number dividing the dividend.
number line A number line is used to visualize numbers. The numbers on the number line get larger as they go from left
to right, and smaller as they go from right to left.
origin The origin is the point labeled 0 on a number line.
place value system Our number system is called a place value system because the value of a digit depends on its
position, or place, in a number.
product The product is the result of multiplying two or more numbers.
quotient The quotient is the result of dividing two numbers.
rounding The process of approximating a number is called rounding.
sum The sum is the result of adding two or more numbers.
whole numbers The whole numbers are the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ….

KEY CONCEPTS
1.1 Introduction to Whole Numbers

Figure 1.16

• Name a whole number in words.
Step 1. Starting at the digit on the left, name the number in each period, followed by the period name. Do not
include the period name for the ones.
Step 2. Use commas in the number to separate the periods.
• Use place value to write a whole number.
Step 1. Identify the words that indicate periods. (Remember the ones period is never named.)
Step 2. Draw three blanks to indicate the number of places needed in each period.
Step 3. Name the number in each period and place the digits in the correct place value position.
• Round a whole number to a specific place value.
Step 1. Locate the given place value. All digits to the left of that place value do not change.
Step 2. Underline the digit to the right of the given place value.
Step 3. Determine if this digit is greater than or equal to 5. If yes—add 1 to the digit in the given place value. If
no—do not change the digit in the given place value.

THE LANGUAGE OF ALGEBRA

Figure 2.1 Algebra has a language of its own. The picture shows just some of the words you may see and use in your study of
Prealgebra.

2.4 Find Multiples and Factors
2.5 Prime Factorization and the Least Common Multiple

Introduction
You may not realize it, but you already use algebra every day. Perhaps you figure out how much to tip a server in a
restaurant. Maybe you calculate the amount of change you should get when you pay for something. It could even be
when you compare batting averages of your favorite players. You can describe the algebra you use in specific words, and
follow an orderly process. In this chapter, you will explore the words used to describe algebra and start on your path to
solving algebraic problems easily, both in class and in your everyday life.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Use variables and algebraic symbols
Identify expressions and equations
Simplify expressions with exponents

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.64.

Use Variables and Algebraic Symbols
20 years old and Alex is
23, so Alex is 3 years older than Greg. When Greg was 12, Alex was 15. When Greg is 35, Alex will be 38. No
matter what Greg’s age is, Alex’s age will always be 3 years more, right?
Greg and Alex have the same birthday, but they were born in different years. This year Greg is

In the language of algebra, we say that Greg’s age and Alex’s age are variable and the three is a constant. The ages
change, or vary, so age is a variable. The 3 years between them always stays the same, so the age difference is the
constant.
In algebra, letters of the alphabet are used to represent variables. Suppose we call Greg’s age

g + 3 to represent Alex’s age. See Table 2.1.

Letters are used to represent variables. Letters often used for variables are

x, y, a, b, and c.

Variables and Constants
A variable is a letter that represents a number or quantity whose value may change.
A constant is a number whose value always stays the same.
To write algebraically, we need some symbols as well as numbers and variables. There are several types of symbols we will
be using. In Whole Numbers, we introduced the symbols for the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. We will summarize them here, along with words we use for the operations and the result.

Operation

Notation

Say:

The result is…

Addition

a+b

a plus b

the sum of a and b

Subtraction

a−b

a minus b

the difference of a and b

Multiplication

a · b, (a)(b), (a)b, a(b)

a times b

The product of a and b

Division

a ÷ b, a / b, a , b a
b

a divided by b

The quotient of a and b

×, is not used to show multiplication because that symbol may cause confusion. Does 3xy
3 × y (three times y ) or 3 · x · y (three times x times y )? To make it clear, use • or parentheses for multiplication.

In algebra, the cross symbol,
mean

We perform these operations on two numbers. When translating from symbolic form to words, or from words to symbolic
form, pay attention to the words of or and to help you find the numbers.
The sum of

5 and 3 means add 5 plus 3, which we write as 5 + 3.

Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra

The difference of

103

9 and 2 means subtract 9 minus 2, which we write as 9 − 2.

The product of

4 and 8 means multiply 4 times 8, which we can write as 4 · 8.

The quotient of

20 and 5 means divide 20 by 5, which we can write as 20 ÷ 5.

Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra

When two quantities have the same value, we say they are equal and connect them with an equal sign.
Equality Symbol

a = b is read a is equal to b
The symbol

= is called the equal sign.

An inequality is used in algebra to compare two quantities that may have different values. The number line can help you
understand inequalities. Remember that on the number line the numbers get larger as they go from left to right. So if we
know that b is greater than a, it means that b is to the right of a on the number line. We use the symbols “<” and

“>” for inequalities.
Inequality

a < b is read a is less than b
a is to the left of b on the number line

a > b is read a is greater than b
a is to the right of b on the number line

The expressions a < b and a
left-to-right. In general,

> b can be read from left-to-right or right-to-left, though in English we usually read from

a < b is equivalent to b > a.
a > b is equivalent to b < a.

For example, 7 < 11 is equivalent to 11 > 7.
For example, 17 > 4 is equivalent to 4 < 17.

a ≤ b, it means a < b or a = b. We read this a is
b. Also, if we put a slash through an equal sign, ≠, it means not equal.

When we write an inequality symbol with a line under it, such as
less than or equal to

We summarize the symbols of equality and inequality in Table 2.2.

Algebraic Notation

Say

a=b

a is equal to b

a≠b

a is not equal to b

a<b

a is less than b

a>b

a is greater than b

a≤b

a is less than or equal to b

a≥b

a is greater than or equal to b

Grouping symbols in algebra are much like the commas, colons, and other punctuation marks in written language. They
indicate which expressions are to be kept together and separate from other expressions. Table 2.3 lists three of the most
commonly used grouping symbols in algebra.

Identify Expressions and Equations
What is the difference in English between a phrase and a sentence? A phrase expresses a single thought that is incomplete
by itself, but a sentence makes a complete statement. “Running very fast” is a phrase, but “The football player was
running very fast” is a sentence. A sentence has a subject and a verb.
In algebra, we have expressions and equations. An expression is like a phrase. Here are some examples of expressions and
how they relate to word phrases:

Expression

Words

3+5

3 plus 5

n−1

the difference of n and one

6·7

x divided by y

the quotient of x and y

Notice that the phrases do not form a complete sentence because the phrase does not have a verb. An equation is

108

Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra

two expressions linked with an equal sign. When you read the words the symbols represent in an equation, you have a
complete sentence in English. The equal sign gives the verb. Here are some examples of equations:

Equation

Sentence

3+5=8

The sum of three and five is equal to eight.

n − 1 = 14

n minus one equals fourteen.

6 · 7 = 42

The product of six and seven is equal to forty-two.

x = 53

x is equal to fifty-three.

y + 9 = 2y − 3

y plus nine is equal to two y minus three.

Expressions and Equations
An expression is a number, a variable, or a combination of numbers and variables and operation symbols.
An equation is made up of two expressions connected by an equal sign.
EXAMPLE 2.4

Simplify Expressions Using the Order of Operations
We’ve introduced most of the symbols and notation used in algebra, but now we need to clarify the order of operations.
Otherwise, expressions may have different meanings, and they may result in different values.
For example, consider the expression:

Some students say it simplifies to 49.
4 + 3·7
Since 4 + 3 gives 7.
7·7
And 7 · 7 is 49.
49

4 + 3·7

Some students say it simplifies to 25.
4 + 3·7
Since 3 · 7 is 21.
4 + 21
And 21 + 4 makes 25.
25

Imagine the confusion that could result if every problem had several different correct answers. The same expression
should give the same result. So mathematicians established some guidelines called the order of operations, which
outlines the order in which parts of an expression must be simplified.
Order of Operations
When simplifying mathematical expressions perform the operations in the following order:
1. Parentheses and other Grouping Symbols
• Simplify all expressions inside the parentheses or other grouping symbols, working on the innermost
parentheses first.
2. Exponents
• Simplify all expressions with exponents.
3. Multiplication and Division
• Perform all multiplication and division in order from left to right. These operations have equal priority.
4. Addition and Subtraction
• Perform all addition and subtraction in order from left to right. These operations have equal priority.
Students often ask, “How will I remember the order?” Here is a way to help you remember: Take the first letter of each
key word and substitute the silly phrase. Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.

112

Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra

Order of Operations
Please

Parentheses

Excuse

Exponents

My Dear

Multiplication and Division

Aunt Sally

Addition and Subtraction

It’s good that ‘My Dear’ goes together, as this reminds us that multiplication and division have equal priority. We do not
always do multiplication before division or always do division before multiplication. We do them in order from left to right.
Similarly, ‘Aunt Sally’ goes together and so reminds us that addition and subtraction also have equal priority and we do
them in order from left to right.

Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity Game of 24 will give you practice using the order of operations.

Evaluate Algebraic Expressions
In the last section, we simplified expressions using the order of operations. In this section, we’ll evaluate
expressions—again following the order of operations.
To evaluate an algebraic expression means to find the value of the expression when the variable is replaced by a given
number. To evaluate an expression, we substitute the given number for the variable in the expression and then simplify
the expression using the order of operations.

Solution

ⓐ To evaluate, substitute 3

for

x in the expression, and then simplify.

Identify Terms, Coefficients, and Like Terms
Algebraic expressions are made up of terms. A term is a constant or the product of a constant and one or more variables.
Some examples of terms are 7, y, 5x 2, 9a, and 13xy.
The constant that multiplies the variable(s) in a term is called the coefficient. We can think of the coefficient as the
number in front of the variable. The coefficient of the term 3x is 3. When we write x, the coefficient is 1, since

x = 1 ⋅ x. Table 2.5 gives the coefficients for each of the terms in the left column.

Some terms share common traits. Look at the following terms. Which ones seem to have traits in common?

5x, 7, n 2, 4, 3x, 9n 2
Which of these terms are like terms?
• The terms

7 and 4 are both constant terms.

• The terms

5x and 3x are both terms with x.

• The terms

n 2 and 9n 2 both have n 2.

Terms are called like terms if they have the same variables and exponents. All constant terms are also like terms. So
among the terms 5x, 7, n 2, 4, 3x, 9n 2,

7 and 4 are like terms.
5x and 3x are like terms.

n 2 and 9n 2 are like terms.
Like Terms
Terms that are either constants or have the same variables with the same exponents are like terms.

Solution

ⓐ y 3, 7x 2, 14, 23, 4y 3, 9x, 5x 2
Look at the variables and exponents. The expression contains

y 3, x 2, x, and constants.

The terms

y 3 and 4y 3 are like terms because they both have y 3.

The terms

7x 2 and 5x 2 are like terms because they both have x 2.

The terms

14 and 23 are like terms because they are both constants.

The term

We can simplify an expression by combining the like terms. What do you think

more of the same thing, the result is 9 of them. For example,
the mathematical properties behind this later.

The expression 3x + 6x has only two terms. When an expression contains more terms, it may be helpful to rearrange
the terms so that like terms are together. The Commutative Property of Addition says that we can change the order of
addends without changing the sum. So we could rearrange the following expression before combining like terms.

Now it is easier to see the like terms to be combined.

When some people hear the word algebra, they think of solving equations. The applications of solving equations are
limitless and extend to all careers and fields. In this section, we will begin solving equations. We will start by solving
basic equations, and then as we proceed through the course we will build up our skills to cover many different forms of
equations.

Determine Whether a Number is a Solution of an Equation
Solving an equation is like discovering the answer to a puzzle. An algebraic equation states that two algebraic expressions
are equal. To solve an equation is to determine the values of the variable that make the equation a true statement. Any
number that makes the equation true is called a solution of the equation. It is the answer to the puzzle!
Solution of an Equation
A solution to an equation is a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation.
The process of finding the solution to an equation is called solving the equation.
To find the solution to an equation means to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true. Can you recognize
the solution of x + 2 = 7 ? If you said 5, you’re right! We say 5 is a solution to the equation x + 2 = 7 because when
we substitute

5 for x the resulting statement is true.

x+2=7
?
5+2=
7
7=7✓
Since

5 + 2 = 7 is a true statement, we know that 5 is indeed a solution to the equation.

?
=
asks whether the left side of the equation is equal to the right side. Once we know, we can change to an
equal sign (=) or not-equal sign (≠).

Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra

Model the Subtraction Property of Equality
We will use a model to help you understand how the process of solving an equation is like solving a puzzle. An envelope
represents the variable – since its contents are unknown – and each counter represents one.
Suppose a desk has an imaginary line dividing it in half. We place three counters and an envelope on the left side of
desk, and eight counters on the right side of the desk as in Figure 2.3. Both sides of the desk have the same number of
counters, but some counters are hidden in the envelope. Can you tell how many counters are in the envelope?

Figure 2.3

What steps are you taking in your mind to figure out how many counters are in the envelope? Perhaps you are thinking
“I need to remove the 3 counters from the left side to get the envelope by itself. Those 3 counters on the left match
with 3 on the right, so I can take them away from both sides. That leaves five counters on the right, so there must be
counters in the envelope.” Figure 2.4 shows this process.

5

Figure 2.4

What algebraic equation is modeled by this situation? Each side of the desk represents an expression and the center line
takes the place of the equal sign. We will call the contents of the envelope x, so the number of counters on the left side
of the desk is
is x + 3

= 8.

x + 3. On the right side of the desk are 8 counters. We are told that x + 3 is equal to 8 so our equation

Figure 2.5

x+3=8
Let’s write algebraically the steps we took to discover how many counters were in the envelope.

First, we took away three from each side.
Then we were left with five.
Now let’s check our solution. We substitute

5 for x in the original equation and see if we get a true statement.

Our solution is correct. Five counters in the envelope plus three more equals eight.
MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity, “Subtraction Property of Equality” will help you develop a better
understanding of how to solve equations by using the Subtraction Property of Equality.

EXAMPLE 2.30
Write an equation modeled by the envelopes and counters, and then solve the equation:

Solution
On the left, write x for the contents of the envelope, add the 4 counters, so we have x + 4 .

x+4

On the right, there are 5 counters.

5

The two sides are equal.

x+4=5

Solve the equation by subtracting 4 counters from each side.

We can see that there is one counter in the envelope. This can be shown algebraically as:

Substitute

Since

x = 1 makes the statement true, we know that 1 is indeed a solution.

Solve Equations Using the Subtraction Property of Equality
Our puzzle has given us an idea of what we need to do to solve an equation. The goal is to isolate the variable by itself on
one side of the equations. In the previous examples, we used the Subtraction Property of Equality, which states that when
we subtract the same quantity from both sides of an equation, we still have equality.

a=b

then

are equal now, and subtracting the same quantity from both of them resulted in equal ages 3 years ago.

Solve Equations Using the Addition Property of Equality
In all the equations we have solved so far, a number was added to the variable on one side of the equation. We used
subtraction to “undo” the addition in order to isolate the variable.
But suppose we have an equation with a number subtracted from the variable, such as
variable, so to “undo” the subtraction we will add the number to both sides.

x − 5 = 8. We want to isolate the

We use the Addition Property of Equality, which says we can add the same number to both sides of the equation without
changing the equality. Notice how it mirrors the Subtraction Property of Equality.

Translate Word Phrases to Algebraic Equations
Remember, an equation has an equal sign between two algebraic expressions. So if we have a sentence that tells us that
two phrases are equal, we can translate it into an equation. We look for clue words that mean equals. Some words that
translate to the equal sign are:
• is equal to
• is the same as
• is
• gives
• was
• will be
It may be helpful to put a box around the equals word(s) in the sentence to help you focus separately on each phrase.
Then translate each phrase into an expression, and write them on each side of the equal sign.
We will practice translating word sentences into algebraic equations. Some of the sentences will be basic number facts
with no variables to solve for. Some sentences will translate into equations with variables. The focus right now is just to
translate the words into algebra.
EXAMPLE 2.35
Translate the sentence into an algebraic equation: The sum of

6 and 9 is 15.

Solution
The word is tells us the equal sign goes between 9 and 15.

Find All the Factors of a Number
m is a multiple of n, we can say that
m is divisible by n. We know that 72 is the product of 8 and 9, so we can say 72 is a multiple of 8 and 72 is a
multiple of 9. We can also say 72 is divisible by 8 and by 9. Another way to talk about this is to say that 8 and 9 are
factors of 72. When we write 72 = 8 ⋅ 9 we can say that we have factored 72.
There are often several ways to talk about the same idea. So far, we’ve seen that if

Factors
If

a ⋅ b = m, then a and b are factors of m, and m is the product of a and b.

In algebra, it can be useful to determine all of the factors of a number. This is called factoring a number, and it can help
us solve many kinds of problems.

We can find all the factors of any counting number by systematically dividing the number by each counting number,
starting with 1. If the quotient is also a counting number, then the divisor and the quotient are factors of the number.
We can stop when the quotient becomes smaller than the divisor.

HOW TO : : FIND ALL THE FACTORS OF A COUNTING NUMBER.
Step 1.

Divide the number by each of the counting numbers, in order, until the quotient is smaller
than the divisor.
◦ If the quotient is a counting number, the divisor and quotient are a pair of factors.
◦ If the quotient is not a counting number, the divisor is not a factor.

Step 2.

List all the factor pairs.

Find the Prime Factorization of a Composite Number
In the previous section, we found the factors of a number. Prime numbers have only two factors, the number 1 and the
prime number itself. Composite numbers have more than two factors, and every composite number can be written as a
unique product of primes. This is called the prime factorization of a number. When we write the prime factorization of a
number, we are rewriting the number as a product of primes. Finding the prime factorization of a composite number will
help you later in this course.
Prime Factorization
The prime factorization of a number is the product of prime numbers that equals the number.

MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity “Prime Numbers” will help you develop a better sense of prime
numbers.
You may want to refer to the following list of prime numbers less than

Prime Factorization Using the Factor Tree Method

One way to find the prime factorization of a number is to make a factor tree. We start by writing the number, and then
writing it as the product of two factors. We write the factors below the number and connect them to the number with a
small line segment—a “branch” of the factor tree.
If a factor is prime, we circle it (like a bud on a tree), and do not factor that “branch” any further. If a factor is not prime,
we repeat this process, writing it as the product of two factors and adding new branches to the tree.
We continue until all the branches end with a prime. When the factor tree is complete, the circled primes give us the prime
factorization.

36. We can start with any factor pair such as 3 and 12. We write 3
12 below 36 with branches connecting them.

For example, let’s find the prime factorization of
and

3 is prime, so we circle it. The factor 12 is composite, so we need to find its factors. Let’s use 3 and 4. We

write these factors on the tree under the

3 is prime, so we circle it. The factor 4 is composite, and it factors into 2 · 2. We write these factors under the

The factor

The prime factorization is the product of the circled primes. We generally write the prime factorization in order from least
to greatest.

2⋅2⋅3⋅3
In cases like this, where some of the prime factors are repeated, we can write prime factorization in exponential form.

2⋅2⋅3⋅3

Note that we could have started our factor tree with any factor pair of

HOW TO : : FIND THE PRIME FACTORIZATION OF A COMPOSITE NUMBER USING THE TREE METHOD.
Step 1.

Find any factor pair of the given number, and use these numbers to create two branches.

Step 2.

If a factor is prime, that branch is complete. Circle the prime.

Step 3.

If a factor is not prime, write it as the product of a factor pair and continue the process.

Step 4.

Write the composite number as the product of all the circled primes.

EXAMPLE 2.48
Find the prime factorization of

48 using the factor tree method.

166

Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra

Solution
We can start our tree using any factor pair of 48. Let's use 2 and 24.
We circle the 2 because it is prime and so that branch is complete.

Now we will factor 24. Let's use 4 and 6.

Neither factor is prime, so we do not circle either.
We factor the 4, using 2 and 2.
We factor 6, using 2 and 3.
We circle the 2s and the 3 since they are prime. Now all of the
branches end in a prime.

Write the product of the circled numbers.

Prime Factorization Using the Ladder Method
The ladder method is another way to find the prime factors of a composite number. It leads to the same result as the
factor tree method. Some people prefer the ladder method to the factor tree method, and vice versa.
To begin building the “ladder,” divide the given number by its smallest prime factor. For example, to start the ladder for
36, we divide 36 by 2, the smallest prime factor of 36.

To add a “step” to the ladder, we continue dividing by the same prime until it no longer divides evenly.

Then we divide by the next prime; so we divide

9 by 3.

We continue dividing up the ladder in this way until the quotient is prime. Since the quotient,
Do you see why the ladder method is sometimes called stacked division?
The prime factorization is the product of all the primes on the sides and top of the ladder.

Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of Two Numbers
One of the reasons we look at multiples and primes is to use these techniques to find the least common multiple of two
numbers. This will be useful when we add and subtract fractions with different denominators.

Listing Multiples Method
A common multiple of two numbers is a number that is a multiple of both numbers. Suppose we want to find common
multiples of 10 and 25. We can list the first several multiples of each number. Then we look for multiples that are
common to both lists—these are the common multiples.

10:10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, …
25:25, 50, 75, 100, 125, …
We see that 50 and 100 appear in both lists. They are common multiples of
multiples if we continued the list of multiples for each.

10 and 25. We would find more common

The smallest number that is a multiple of two numbers is called the least common multiple (LCM). So the least LCM of
10 and 25 is 50.

HOW TO : : FIND THE LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE (LCM) OF TWO NUMBERS BY LISTING MULTIPLES.
Step 1.

List the first several multiples of each number.

Step 2.

Look for multiples common to both lists. If there are no common multiples in the lists, write
out additional multiples for each number.

Step 3.

Look for the smallest number that is common to both lists.

Step 4.

This number is the LCM.

EXAMPLE 2.52
Find the LCM of

15 and 20 by listing multiples.

Solution
List the first several multiples of

15 and of 20. Identify the first common multiple.

15: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120
20: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160

Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra

The smallest number to appear on both lists is
Notice that

60, so 60 is the least common multiple of 15 and 20.

120 is on both lists, too. It is a common multiple, but it is not the least common multiple.

18 and 24

Prime Factors Method
Another way to find the least common multiple of two numbers is to use their prime factors. We’ll use this method to find
the LCM of 12 and 18.
We start by finding the prime factorization of each number.

12 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3

18 = 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 3

Then we write each number as a product of primes, matching primes vertically when possible.

12 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3
18 = 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 3
Now we bring down the primes in each column. The LCM is the product of these factors.

Notice that the prime factors of

12 and the prime factors of 18 are included in the LCM. By matching up the common

primes, each common prime factor is used only once. This ensures that

HOW TO : : FIND THE LCM USING THE PRIME FACTORS METHOD.
Step 1.

Step 2.

Write each number as a product of primes, matching primes vertically when possible.

Step 3.

Bring down the primes in each column.

Step 4.

Multiply the factors to get the LCM.

EXAMPLE 2.53

Introduction
At over 29,000 feet, Mount Everest stands as the tallest peak on land. Located along the border of Nepal and China,
Mount Everest is also known for its extreme climate. Near the summit, temperatures never rise above freezing. Every
year, climbers from around the world brave the extreme conditions in an effort to scale the tremendous height. Only
some are successful. Describing the drastic change in elevation the climbers experience and the change in temperatures
requires using numbers that extend both above and below zero. In this chapter, we will describe these kinds of numbers
and operations using them.

Chapter 3 Integers

Locate Positive and Negative Numbers on the Number Line
Do you live in a place that has very cold winters? Have you ever experienced a temperature below zero? If so, you are
already familiar with negative numbers. A negative number is a number that is less than 0. Very cold temperatures are

−1°F (read as “negative one
1 degree below 0. A minus sign is shown before a number to indicate that it is negative. Figure
3.2 shows −20°F, which is 20 degrees below 0.
measured in degrees below zero and can be described by negative numbers. For example,
degree Fahrenheit”) is

Figure 3.2 Temperatures below zero are
described by negative numbers.

Temperatures are not the only negative numbers. A bank overdraft is another example of a negative number. If a person
writes a check for more than he has in his account, his balance will be negative.
Elevations can also be represented by negative numbers. The elevation at sea level is 0 feet. Elevations above sea level
are positive and elevations below sea level are negative. The elevation of the Dead Sea, which borders Israel and Jordan,
is about 1,302 feet below sea level, so the elevation of the Dead Sea can be represented as −1,302 feet. See Figure 3.3.

Figure 3.3 The surface of the Mediterranean Sea has an elevation of 0 ft. The diagram shows that
nearby mountains have higher (positive) elevations whereas the Dead Sea has a lower (negative)
elevation.

Depths below the ocean surface are also described by negative numbers. A submarine, for example, might descend to a
depth of 500 feet. Its position would then be −500 feet as labeled in Figure 3.4.

Figure 3.4 Depths below sea level are described by negative numbers. A
submarine 500 ft below sea level is at −500 ft.

Both positive and negative numbers can be represented on a number line. Recall that the number line created in Add
Whole Numbers started at 0 and showed the counting numbers increasing to the right as shown in Figure 3.5. The

(1, 2, 3, …) on the number line are all positive. We could write a plus sign, +, before a positive
number such as +2 or +3, but it is customary to omit the plus sign and write only the number. If there is no sign, the
counting numbers

number is assumed to be positive.

Figure 3.5

Now we need to extend the number line to include negative numbers. We mark several units to the left of zero, keeping
the intervals the same width as those on the positive side. We label the marks with negative numbers, starting with −1
at the first mark to the left of

0, −2 at the next mark, and so on. See Figure 3.6.

Figure 3.6 On a number line, positive numbers are to the
right of zero. Negative numbers are to the left of zero. What
about zero? Zero is neither positive nor negative.

The arrows at either end of the line indicate that the number line extends forever in each direction. There is no greatest
positive number and there is no smallest negative number.

Order Positive and Negative Numbers
We can use the number line to compare and order positive and negative numbers. Going from left to right, numbers
increase in value. Going from right to left, numbers decrease in value. See Figure 3.10.

Figure 3.10

Just as we did with positive numbers, we can use inequality symbols to show the ordering of positive and negative
numbers. Remember that we use the notation a < b (read a is less than b ) when a is to the left of b on the number

a > b (read a is greater than b ) when a is to the right of b on the number line. This is shown for the
3 and 5 in Figure 3.11.

numbers

3 is to the left of
5 on the number line. So 3 is less than
5, and 5 is greater than 3.

Find Opposites
On the number line, the negative numbers are a mirror image of the positive numbers with zero in the middle. Because
the numbers 2 and −2 are the same distance from zero, they are called opposites. The opposite of 2 is −2, and the
opposite of

−2 is 2 as shown in Figure 3.13(a). Similarly, 3 and −3 are opposites as shown in Figure 3.13(b).

188

Opposite
The opposite of a number is the number that is the same distance from zero on the number line, but on the opposite
side of zero.
EXAMPLE 3.3
Find the opposite of each number:

ⓐ7

ⓑ −10

Solution

ⓐ The number −7

is the same distance from

7 as shown in Figure 3.14.

0 as 7, but on the opposite side of 0. So −7 is the opposite

Chapter 3 Integers

189

The specific meaning becomes clear by looking at how it is used. You have seen the symbol

“−”, in three different ways.

10 − 4

Between two numbers, the symbol indicates the operation of subtraction.
We read 10 − 4 as 10 minus 4 .

−8

In front of a number, the symbol indicates a negative number.
We read −8 as negative eight.

−x

In front of a variable or a number, it indicates the opposite.
We read −x as the opposite of x .

− (−2)

Here we have two signs. The sign in the parentheses indicates that the number is negative 2.
The sign outside the parentheses indicates the opposite. We read − (−2) as the opposite of

−2.

Opposite Notation

−a means the opposite of the number a
The notation

−a is read the opposite of a.

Simplify Expressions with Absolute Value
We saw that numbers such as

5 and −5 are opposites because they are the same distance from 0 on the number line.

They are both five units from 0. The distance between 0 and any number on the number line is called the absolute
value of that number. Because distance is never negative, the absolute value of any number is never negative.
The symbol for absolute value is two vertical lines on either side of a number. So the absolute value of

|5|,

and the absolute value of

−5 is written as |−5| as shown in Figure 3.16.

Solution
Look for key phrases in each sentence. Then look for words that indicate negative signs. Don’t forget to include units of
measurement described in the sentence.

ⓐ

The temperature is 12 degrees Fahrenheit below zero.

Below zero tells us that 12 is a negative number.

ⓑ

The football team had a gain of 3 yards.

A gain tells us that 3 is a positive number.

3 yards

ⓒ

The elevation of the Dead Sea is 1,302 feet below sea
level.

Below sea level tells us that 1,302 is a negative
number.

Model Addition of Integers
Now that we have located positive and negative numbers on the number line, it is time to discuss arithmetic operations
with integers.
Most students are comfortable with the addition and subtraction facts for positive numbers. But doing addition or
subtraction with both positive and negative numbers may be more difficult. This difficulty relates to the way the brain
learns.
The brain learns best by working with objects in the real world and then generalizing to abstract concepts. Toddlers learn
quickly that if they have two cookies and their older brother steals one, they have only one left. This is a concrete example
of 2 − 1. Children learn their basic addition and subtraction facts from experiences in their everyday lives. Eventually,
they know the number facts without relying on cookies.
Addition and subtraction of negative numbers have fewer real world examples that are meaningful to us. Math teachers
have several different approaches, such as number lines, banking, temperatures, and so on, to make these concepts real.
We will model addition and subtraction of negatives with two color counters. We let a blue counter represent a positive
and a red counter will represent a negative.

If we have one positive and one negative counter, the value of the pair is zero. They form a neutral pair. The value of this
neutral pair is zero as summarized in Figure 3.17.

Figure 3.17 A blue counter represents
+1. A red counter represents −1.
Together they add to zero.

MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Addition of signed Numbers" will help you develop a better
understanding of adding integers.

Simplify Expressions with Integers
Now that you have modeled adding small positive and negative integers, you can visualize the model in your mind to
simplify expressions with any integers.
For example, if you want to add
Picture

37 + (−53), you don’t have to count out 37 blue counters and 53 red counters.

37 blue counters with 53 red counters lined up underneath. Since there would be more negative counters than
53−37 = 16, there are 16 more negative counters.

positive counters, the sum would be negative. Because

37 + (−53) = −16
Let’s try another one. We’ll add

−74 + (−27). Imagine 74 red counters and 27 more red counters, so we have 101
−101.

red counters all together. This means the sum is

−74 + (−27) = −101
Look again at the results of Example 3.14 - Example 3.17.

5+3

−5 + (−3)

both positive, sum positive

both negative, sum negative

When the signs are the same, the counters would be all the same color, so add them.

−5 + 3

5 + (−3)

different signs, more negatives

different signs, more positives

Sum negative

sum positive

When the signs are different, some counters would make neutral pairs; subtract to see how many are left.

Add Integers in Applications
Recall that we were introduced to some situations in everyday life that use positive and negative numbers, such as
temperatures, banking, and sports. For example, a debt of $5 could be represented as −$5. Let’s practice translating
and solving a few applications.

Solving applications is easy if we have a plan. First, we determine what we are looking for. Then we write a phrase that
gives the information to find it. We translate the phrase into math notation and then simplify to get the answer. Finally,
we write a sentence to answer the question.
EXAMPLE 3.28
The temperature in Buffalo, NY, one morning started at

12 degrees. What was the temperature at noon?

7 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. By noon, it had warmed up

Model Subtraction of Integers
Remember the story in the last section about the toddler and the cookies? Children learn how to subtract numbers
through their everyday experiences. Real-life experiences serve as models for subtracting positive numbers, and in some
cases, such as temperature, for adding negative as well as positive numbers. But it is difficult to relate subtracting
negative numbers to common life experiences. Most people do not have an intuitive understanding of subtraction when
negative numbers are involved. Math teachers use several different models to explain subtracting negative numbers.
We will continue to use counters to model subtraction. Remember, the blue counters represent positive numbers and the
red counters represent negative numbers.
Perhaps when you were younger, you read
subtraction the same way.

5 − 3 as five take away three. When we use counters, we can think of

MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS

Chapter 3 Integers

• First, we subtracted

3 positives from 5 positives to get 2 positives.

• Then we subtracted

3 negatives from 5 negatives to get 2 negatives.

Each example used counters of only one color, and the “take away” model of subtraction was easy to apply.

Now let’s see what happens when we subtract one positive and one negative number. We will need to use both positive
and negative counters and sometimes some neutral pairs, too. Adding a neutral pair does not change the value.
EXAMPLE 3.32
Model:

−5 − 3.

Solution
Interpret the expression.

−5 − 3 means −5 take away 3 .

Model the first number. Start with 5 negatives.
Take away the second number.
So we need to take away 3 positives.
But there are no positives to take away.
Add neutral pairs until you have 3 positives.

Now take away 3 positives.

Count the number of counters that are left.

−5 − 3 = −8 .

Simplify Expressions with Integers
Do you see a pattern? Are you ready to subtract integers without counters? Let’s do two more subtractions. We’ll think
about how we would model these with counters, but we won’t actually use the counters.
• Subtract

−23 − 7.

23 negative counters.
7 positives, but there are no positives to take away.
So we add 7 neutral pairs to get the 7 positives. Now we take away the 7 positives.
So what’s left? We have the original 23 negatives plus 7 more negatives from the neutral pair. The result is 30
Think: We start with

We have to subtract

negatives.

−23 − 7 = −30
Notice, that to subtract

7, we added 7 negatives.

30 − (−12).
30 positives.
We have to subtract 12 negatives, but there are no negatives to take away.
So we add 12 neutral pairs to the 30 positives. Now we take away the 12 negatives.
What’s left? We have the original 30 positives plus 12 more positives from the neutral pairs. The result is 42

• Subtract

Think: We start with

positives.

30 − (−12) = 42
Notice that to subtract

−12, we added 12.

While we may not always use the counters, especially when we work with large numbers, practicing with them first gave
us a concrete way to apply the concept, so that we can visualize and remember how to do the subtraction without the

counters.
Have you noticed that subtraction of signed numbers can be done by adding the opposite? You will often see the idea,
the Subtraction Property, written as follows:
Subtraction Property

a − b = a + (−b)
Look at these two examples.

We see that

6 − 4 gives the same answer as 6 + (−4).

Of course, when we have a subtraction problem that has only positive numbers, like the first example, we just do the
subtraction. We already knew how to subtract 6 − 4 long ago. But knowing that 6 − 4 gives the same answer as

6 + (−4) helps when we are subtracting negative numbers.
EXAMPLE 3.36

Simplify:

ⓐ 13 − 8 and 13 + (−8)

ⓑ −17 − 9 and −17 + (−9)

Solution

ⓐ
13 − 8 and 13 + (−8)

ⓐ
9 − (−15) and 9 + 15

Subtract Integers in Applications

It’s hard to find something if we don’t know what we’re looking for or what to call it. So when we solve an application
problem, we first need to determine what we are asked to find. Then we can write a phrase that gives the information
to find it. We’ll translate the phrase into an expression and then simplify the expression to get the answer. Finally, we
summarize the answer in a sentence to make sure it makes sense.

Multiply Integers
Since multiplication is mathematical shorthand for repeated addition, our counter model can easily be applied to show
multiplication of integers. Let’s look at this concrete model to see what patterns we notice. We will use the same examples
that we used for addition and subtraction.
We remember that

a · b means add a, b times. Here, we are using the model shown in Figure 3.19 just to help us

In both cases, we started with

Notice that for multiplication of two signed numbers, when the signs are the same, the product is positive, and when the
signs are different, the product is negative.

Divide Integers
15 ÷ 3 = 5 because 5 · 3 = 15 In words, this expression says that
15 can be divided into 3 groups of 5 each because adding five three times gives 15. If we look at some examples of

Division is the inverse operation of multiplication. So,

multiplying integers, we might figure out the rules for dividing integers.

5 · 3 = 15 so 15 ÷ 3 = 5
(−5)(−3) = 15 so 15 ÷ (−3) = −5

−5(3) = −15 so −15 ÷ 3 = −5
5(−3) = −15 so −15 ÷ −3 = 5

Division of signed numbers follows the same rules as multiplication. When the signs are the same, the quotient is positive,
and when the signs are different, the quotient is negative.

Determine Whether a Number is a Solution of an Equation
In Solve Equations with the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality, we saw that a solution of an equation is
a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into that equation. In that section, we found solutions
that were whole numbers. Now that we’ve worked with integers, we’ll find integer solutions to equations.
The steps we take to determine whether a number is a solution to an equation are the same whether the solution is a
whole number or an integer.

HOW TO : : HOW TO DETERMINE WHETHER A NUMBER IS A SOLUTION TO AN EQUATION.
Step 1.

Substitute the number for the variable in the equation.

Step 2.

Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation.

Step 3.

Determine whether the resulting equation is true.
◦ If it is true, the number is a solution.
◦ If it is not true, the number is not a solution.

Solve Equations with Integers Using the Addition and Subtraction Properties of
Equality
In Solve Equations with the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality, we solved equations similar to the two
shown here using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality. Now we can use them again with integers.

Chapter 3 Integers

When you add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you still have equality.
Properties of Equalities

Subtraction Property of Equality

For any numbers a, b, c,
if a = b then a − c = b − c.

Addition Property of Equality

For any numbers a, b, c,
if a = b then a + c = b + c.

Model the Division Property of Equality
All of the equations we have solved so far have been of the form x + a = b or x − a = b. We were able to isolate the
variable by adding or subtracting the constant term. Now we’ll see how to solve equations that involve division.
We will model an equation with envelopes and counters in Figure 3.21.

Figure 3.21

Here, there are two identical envelopes that contain the same number of counters. Remember, the left side of the
workspace must equal the right side, but the counters on the left side are “hidden” in the envelopes. So how many
counters are in each envelope?

2 groups of the same size. So 6 counters divided
2 groups means there must be 3 counters in each group (since 6 ÷ 2 = 3).

To determine the number, separate the counters on the right side into
into

x counters.
6 counters. So the equation that models the situation is 2x = 6.

What equation models the situation shown in Figure 3.22? There are two envelopes, and each contains
Together, the two envelopes must contain a total of

Figure 3.23 shows another example.

Figure 3.23

3 identical envelopes and 12 counters. How many counters are in each envelope? We have to separate
12 counters into 3 groups. Since 12 ÷ 3 = 4, there must be 4 counters in each envelope. See Figure 3.24.

Now we have
the

The equation that models the situation is

Does this check? It does because

3x = 12. We can divide both sides of the equation by 3.

3 · 4 = 12.

Introduction
Often in life, whole amounts are not exactly what we need. A baker must use a little more than a cup of milk or part of
a teaspoon of sugar. Similarly a carpenter might need less than a foot of wood and a painter might use part of a gallon
of paint. In this chapter, we will learn about numbers that describe parts of a whole. These numbers, called fractions, are
very useful both in algebra and in everyday life. You will discover that you are already familiar with many examples of
fractions!

Andy and Bobby love pizza. On Monday night, they share a pizza equally. How much of the pizza does each one get? Are
you thinking that each boy gets half of the pizza? That’s right. There is one whole pizza, evenly divided into two parts, so
each boy gets one of the two equal parts.
In math, we write

In Example 4.1 and Example 4.2, we used circles and rectangles to model fractions. Fractions can also be modeled as
manipulatives called fraction tiles, as shown in Figure 4.3. Here, the whole is modeled as one long, undivided rectangular
tile. Beneath it are tiles of equal length divided into different numbers of equally sized parts.

Figure 4.3

We’ll be using fraction tiles to discover some basic facts about fractions. Refer to Figure 4.3 to answer the following
questions:

How many 1 tiles does it take to make one whole tile?

How many 1 tiles does it take to make one whole tile?
3

How many 1 tiles does it take to make one whole tile?
4
How many 1 tiles does it take to make one whole tile?

6

What if the whole were divided into 24 equal parts? (We have not shown
fraction tiles to represent this, but try to visualize it in your mind.) How many

1 tiles does it take to make one whole tile?
24

It takes

24 twenty-fourths, so 24 = 1.
24

This leads us to the Property of One.
Property of One
Any number, except zero, divided by itself is one.

It takes two halves to
make a whole, so two
out of two is 2 = 1.

2

It takes three thirds, so
three out of three is

3 = 1.
3

It takes four fourths, so
four out of four is

4 = 1.

It takes six sixths, so six
out of six is 6 = 1.

It takes 24 twentyfourths, so 24 = 1.

Equivalent Fractions Property
If

a = a·c
b b·c

When working with fractions, it is often necessary to express the same fraction in different forms. To find equivalent forms
of a fraction, we can use the Equivalent Fractions Property. For example, consider the fraction one-half.

In Introduction to Integers, we defined the opposite of a number. It is the number that is the same distance from zero
on the number line but on the opposite side of zero. We saw, for example, that the opposite of 7 is −7 and the opposite
of

−7 is 7.

Simplify Fractions
In working with equivalent fractions, you saw that there are many ways to write fractions that have the same value, or
represent the same part of the whole. How do you know which one to use? Often, we’ll use the fraction that is in simplified
form.
A fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors, other than

1, in the numerator and denominator. If a

fraction does have common factors in the numerator and denominator, we can reduce the fraction to its simplified form
by removing the common factors.
Simplified Fraction
A fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors in the numerator and denominator.
For example,
•

2 is simplified because there are no common factors of 2 and 3.
3

•

10 is not simplified because 5 is a common factor of 10 and 15.
15

The process of simplifying a fraction is often called reducing the fraction. In the previous section, we used the Equivalent
Fractions Property to find equivalent fractions. We can also use the Equivalent Fractions Property in reverse to simplify
fractions. We rewrite the property to show both forms together.
Equivalent Fractions Property
If

a, b, c are numbers where b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0, then
a = a·c
b b·c

and

a · c = a.
b·c b

Notice that c is a common factor in the numerator and denominator. Anytime we have a common factor in the numerator
and denominator, it can be removed.

After simplifying a fraction, it is always important to check the result to make sure that the numerator and denominator do
not have any more factors in common. Remember, the definition of a simplified fraction: a fraction is considered simplified
if there are no common factors in the numerator and denominator.
When we simplify an improper fraction, there is no need to change it to a mixed number.

prime factors.) Then divide out the common factors using the Equivalent Fractions Property.

A number and its reciprocal have a product of

1.
a·b =1
b a

To find the reciprocal of a fraction, we invert the fraction. This means that we place the numerator in the denominator
and the denominator in the numerator.
To get a positive result when multiplying two numbers, the numbers must have the same sign. So reciprocals must have
the same sign.

To find the reciprocal, keep the same sign and invert the fraction. The number zero does not have a reciprocal. Why? A
number and its reciprocal multiply to 1. Is there any number r so that 0 · r = 1 ? No. So, the number 0 does not have
a reciprocal.

as, “How many quarters are there in two dollars?”

One dollar is 4 quarters, so 2 dollars would be 8 quarters. So again, 2 ÷ 1 = 8.

Let’s use money to model

Figure 4.6 The U.S. coin called a quarter is

reciprocals. This leads us to the procedure for fraction division.
Fraction Division
If

a, b, c, and d are numbers where b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0, and d ≠ 0, then
a ÷ c = a·d
b d b c

To divide fractions, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.
We need to say

b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0 and d ≠ 0 to be sure we don’t divide by zero.

Translate Phrases to Expressions with Fractions
The words quotient and ratio are often used to describe fractions. In Subtract Whole Numbers, we defined quotient as
the result of division. The quotient of a and b is the result you get from dividing a by b , or a . Let’s practice translating

b

some phrases into algebraic expressions using these terms.
EXAMPLE 4.41
Translate the phrase into an algebraic expression: “the quotient of

3x and 8.”

Solution
The keyword is quotient; it tells us that the operation is division. Look for the words of and and to find the numbers to
divide.

The quotient of 3x and 8.

This tells us that we need to divide

3x by 8. 3x

Simplify Complex Fractions
Our work with fractions so far has included proper fractions, improper fractions, and mixed numbers. Another kind of
fraction is called complex fraction, which is a fraction in which the numerator or the denominator contains a fraction.
Some examples of complex fractions are:

Simplify Expressions with a Fraction Bar
Where does the negative sign go in a fraction? Usually, the negative sign is placed in front of the fraction, but you will
sometimes see a fraction with a negative numerator or denominator. Remember that fractions represent division. The
fraction

− 1 could be the result of dividing −1 , a negative by a positive, or of dividing 1 , a positive by a negative.

−3

When the numerator and denominator have different signs, the quotient is negative.

If both the numerator and denominator are negative, then the fraction itself is positive because we are dividing a negative
by a negative.

Fraction bars act as grouping symbols. The expressions above and below the fraction bar should be treated as if they were
in parentheses. For example,

4 + 8 means (4 + 8) ÷ (5 − 3). The order of operations tells us to simplify the numerator
5−3

and the denominator first—as if there were parentheses—before we divide.

We’ll add fraction bars to our set of grouping symbols from Use the Language of Algebra to have a more complete set

Find the Least Common Denominator
In the previous section, we explained how to add and subtract fractions with a common denominator. But how can we
add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators?
Let’s think about coins again. Can you add one quarter and one dime? You could say there are two coins, but that’s not
very useful. To find the total value of one quarter plus one dime, you change them to the same kind of unit—cents. One
quarter equals 25 cents and one dime equals 10 cents, so the sum is 35 cents. See Figure 4.7.

Figure 4.7 Together, a quarter and a dime
are worth

35

cents, or

35
100

of a dollar.

Similarly, when we add fractions with different denominators we have to convert them to equivalent fractions with a
common denominator. With the coins, when we convert to cents, the denominator is 100. Since there are 100 cents in
one dollar,

25 cents is 25 and 10 cents is 10 . So we add 25 + 10 to get 35 , which is 35 cents.

You have practiced adding and subtracting fractions with common denominators. Now let’s see what you need to do with
fractions that have different denominators.

If we try the

If we were to try the

Even smaller tiles, such as

The denominator of the largest piece that covers both fractions is the least common denominator (LCD) of the two

MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Finding the Least Common Denominator" will help you develop a better
understanding of the LCD.

Least Common Denominator
The least common denominator (LCD) of two fractions is the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators.
To find the LCD of two fractions, we will find the LCM of their denominators. We follow the procedure we used earlier to
find the LCM of two numbers. We only use the denominators of the fractions, not the numerators, when finding the LCD.

We can use the Equivalent Fractions Property to algebraically change a fraction to an equivalent one. Remember, two
fractions are equivalent if they have the same value. The Equivalent Fractions Property is repeated below for reference.

If

a, b, c are whole numbers where b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0, then
a = a·c

and

a·c = a

To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, we will first have to convert each fraction to an equivalent
fraction with the LCD. Let’s see how to change
models.

When we use the Equivalent Fractions Property, there is a quick way to find the number you need to multiply by to get
the LCD. Write the factors of the denominators and the LCD just as you did to find the LCD. The “missing” factors of each
denominator are the numbers you need.

The LCD,

36, has 2 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 3.

2, but only one of 3 —so it is ‘missing‘ one 3. We multiplied the numerator and denominator

of

Identify and Use Fraction Operations
By now in this chapter, you have practiced multiplying, dividing, adding, and subtracting fractions. The following table
summarizes these four fraction operations. Remember: You need a common denominator to add or subtract fractions,
but not to multiply or divide fractions
Summary of Fraction Operations
Fraction multiplication: Multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.

a · c = ac
b d bd

Fraction division: Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.

a ÷ c = a·d
b d b c
Fraction addition: Add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator. If the fractions have
different denominators, first convert them to equivalent forms with the LCD.

a + b = a+b
c c
c
Fraction subtraction: Subtract the numerators and place the difference over the common denominator. If the
fractions have different denominators, first convert them to equivalent forms with the LCD.

a − b = a−b
c c

Use the Order of Operations to Simplify Complex Fractions
In Multiply and Divide Mixed Numbers and Complex Fractions, we saw that a complex fraction is a fraction in which the
numerator or denominator contains a fraction. We simplified complex fractions by rewriting them as division problems.
For example,
3
4
5
8

=3÷5
4 8

Now we will look at complex fractions in which the numerator or denominator can be simplified. To follow the order
of operations, we simplify the numerator and denominator separately first. Then we divide the numerator by the
denominator.

If Don has

2 dollars and 1 quarter, he has 2 1 dollars.

3 dollars and 2 quarters. They add the dollars and add
the quarters. This makes 3 2 dollars. Because two quarters is half a dollar, they would have 3 and a half dollars, or 3 1

Model Subtraction of Mixed Numbers
Let’s think of pizzas again to model subtraction of mixed numbers with a common denominator. Suppose you just baked
a whole pizza and want to give your brother half of the pizza. What do you have to do to the pizza to give him half? You
have to cut it into at least two pieces. Then you can give him half.
We will use fraction circles (pizzas!) to help us visualize the process.
Start with one whole.

Algebraically, you would write:

What if you start with a mixed number and need to subtract a fraction? Think about this situation: You need to put three
quarters in a parking meter, but you have only a $1 bill and one quarter. What could you do? You could change the dollar
bill into

4 quarters. The value of 4 quarters is the same as one dollar bill, but the 4 quarters are more useful for the
$1 bill and one quarter, you have 5 quarters and can put 3 quarters in the

parking meter. Now, instead of having a
meter.

This models what happens when we subtract a fraction from a mixed number. We subtracted three quarters from one
dollar and one quarter.
We can also model this using fraction circles, much like we did for addition of mixed numbers.
EXAMPLE 4.89
Use a model to subtract:

Determine Whether a Fraction is a Solution of an Equation
As we saw in Solve Equations with the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality and Solve Equations Using
Integers; The Division Property of Equality, a solution of an equation is a value that makes a true statement when
substituted for the variable in the equation. In those sections, we found whole number and integer solutions to equations.
Now that we have worked with fractions, we are ready to find fraction solutions to equations.
The steps we take to determine whether a number is a solution to an equation are the same whether the solution is a
whole number, an integer, or a fraction.

HOW TO : : DETERMINE WHETHER A NUMBER IS A SOLUTION TO AN EQUATION.
Step 1.

Substitute the number for the variable in the equation.

Step 2.

Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation.

Step 3.

Determine whether the resulting equation is true. If it is true, the number is a solution. If it is
not true, the number is not a solution.

Solve Equations with Fractions using the Addition, Subtraction, and Division Properties
of Equality
In Solve Equations with the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality and Solve Equations Using Integers;
The Division Property of Equality, we solved equations using the Addition, Subtraction, and Division Properties of
Equality. We will use these same properties to solve equations with fractions.
Addition, Subtraction, and Division Properties of Equality
For any numbers

a, b, and c,
if a = b, then a + c = b + c.

Addition Property of Equality

if a = b, then a − c = b − c.

Subtraction Property of Equality

if a = b, then ac = bc , c ≠ 0.

Division Property of Equality

In other words, when you add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an equation, or divide both sides by
the same quantity, you still have equality.

Solve Equations with Fractions Using the Multiplication Property of Equality
Consider the equation

x = 3. We want to know what number divided by 4 gives 3. So to “undo” the division, we will
4

need to multiply by 4. The Multiplication Property of Equality will allow us to do this. This property says that if we start with
two equal quantities and multiply both by the same number, the results are equal.
The Multiplication Property of Equality

Look at the equation

not isolated.
There are three different ways to isolate the variable in this type of equation. We will show all three ways in Example
4.101.
EXAMPLE 4.101
Solve:

−y = 15.

Solution
One way to solve the equation is to rewrite

−y as −1y, and then use the Division Property of Equality to isolate y.

Rewrite −y as −1y .
Divide both sides by −1.
Simplify each side.
Another way to solve this equation is to multiply both sides of the equation by

−1.

Multiply both sides by −1.

The third way to solve the equation is to read

Solve Equations with a Fraction Coefficient
When we have an equation with a fraction coefficient we can use the Multiplication Property of Equality to make the
coefficient equal to 1.
For example, in the equation:

3 x = 24
4
x is 3 . To solve for x, we need its coefficient to be 1. Since the product of a number and its reciprocal
4
is 1, our strategy here will be to isolate x by multiplying by the reciprocal of 3 . We will do this in Example 4.102.

Translate Sentences to Equations and Solve
Now we have covered all four properties of equality—subtraction, addition, division, and multiplication. We’ll list them all
together here for easy reference.

Subtraction Property of Equality:
For any real numbers a, b, and c,

Addition Property of Equality:
For any real numbers a, b, and c,

if a = b, then a − c = b − c.

if a = b, then a + c = b + c.

Division Property of Equality:
For any numbers a, b, and c, where c ≠ 0

Multiplication Property of Equality:
For any real numbers a, b, and c

b
if a = b, then a
c=c

if a = b, then ac = bc

When you add, subtract, multiply or divide the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you still have equality.
In the next few examples, we’ll translate sentences into equations and then solve the equations. It might be helpful to
review the translation table in Evaluate, Simplify, and Translate Expressions.

Introduction
Gasoline price changes all the time. They might go down for a period of time, but then they usually rise again. One thing
that stays the same is that the price is not usually a whole number. Instead, it is shown using a decimal point to describe
the cost in dollars and cents. We use decimal numbers all the time, especially when dealing with money. In this chapter,
we will explore decimal numbers and how to perform operations using them.

You probably already know quite a bit about decimals based on your experience with money. Suppose you buy a sandwich
and a bottle of water for lunch. If the sandwich costs $3.45 , the bottle of water costs $1.25 , and the total sales tax is

$0.33 , what is the total cost of your lunch?

The total is

$5.03. Suppose you pay with a $5 bill and 3 pennies. Should you wait for change? No, $5 and 3 pennies

Writing a number with a decimal is known as decimal notation. It is a way of showing parts of a whole when the whole is
a power of ten. In other words, decimals are another way of writing fractions whose denominators are powers of ten. Just
as the counting numbers are based on powers of ten, decimals are based on powers of ten. Table 5.1 shows the counting
numbers.

When we name a whole number, the name corresponds to the place value based on the powers of ten. In Whole
Numbers, we learned to read 10,000 as ten thousand. Likewise, the names of the decimal places correspond to their
fraction values. Notice how the place value names in Figure 5.2 relate to the names of the fractions from Table 5.2.

Figure 5.2 This chart illustrates place
values to the left and right of the decimal
point.

Notice two important facts shown in Figure 5.2.
• The “th” at the end of the name means the number is a fraction. “One thousand” is a number larger than one,
but “one thousandth” is a number smaller than one.
• The tenths place is the first place to the right of the decimal, but the tens place is two places to the left of the
decimal.

$5.03 lunch? We read $5.03 as five dollars and three cents. Naming decimals (those that don’t represent
money) is done in a similar way. We read the number 5.03 as five and three hundredths.
Remember that

We sometimes need to translate a number written in decimal notation into words. As shown in Figure 5.3, we write the
amount on a check in both words and numbers.

Figure 5.3 When we write a check, we write the amount as a
decimal number as well as in words. The bank looks at the
check to make sure both numbers match. This helps prevent
errors.

Let’s try naming a decimal, such as 15.68.
We start by naming the number to the left of the decimal.

fifteen______

We use the word “and” to indicate the decimal point.

fifteen and_____

Then we name the number to the right of the decimal point as if it were a
whole number.

fifteen and sixty-eight_____

Last, name the decimal place of the last digit.

fifteen and sixty-eight

The number

15.68 is read fifteen and sixty-eight hundredths.

Now we will translate the name of a decimal number into decimal notation. We will reverse the procedure we just used.
Let’s start by writing the number six and seventeen hundredths:

14. _________

Mark two places to the right of the decimal point for “hundredths”.

14.__ __

Translate the words after “and” and write the number to the right
of the decimal point.

TRY IT : : 5.3

Write as a decimal: thirteen and sixty-eight hundredths.

TRY IT : : 5.4

Write as a decimal: five and eight hundred ninety-four thousandths.

HOW TO : : WRITE A DECIMAL NUMBER FROM ITS NAME.
Step 1.

Look for the word “and”—it locates the decimal point.

Step 2.

Mark the number of decimal places needed to the right of the decimal point by noting the
place value indicated by the last word.
◦ Place a decimal point under the word “and.” Translate the words before “and” into the
whole number and place it to the left of the decimal point.
◦ If there is no “and,” write a “0” with a decimal point to its right.

Step 3.

Translate the words after “and” into the number to the right of the decimal point. Write the
number in the spaces—putting the final digit in the last place.

Step 4.

Fill in zeros for place holders as needed.

The second bullet in Step 2 is needed for decimals that have no whole number part, like ‘nine thousandths’. We recognize
them by the words that indicate the place value after the decimal – such as ‘tenths’ or ‘hundredths.’ Since there is no
whole number, there is no ‘and.’ We start by placing a zero to the left of the decimal and continue by filling in the numbers
to the right, as we did above.
EXAMPLE 5.3
Write twenty-four thousandths as a decimal.

0.

Look for the word "and".
To the right of the decimal point, put three decimal places for
thousandths.
Write the number 24 with the 4 in the thousandths place.
Put zeros as placeholders in the remaining decimal places.

0.024
So, twenty-four thousandths is
written 0.024

Before we move on to our next objective, think about money again. We know that
write

5 = 5.0
−2 = −2.0
5 = 5.00
−2 = −2.00
5 = 5.000
−2 = −2.000
and so on…

Convert Decimals to Fractions or Mixed Numbers

We often need to rewrite decimals as fractions or mixed numbers. Let’s go back to our lunch order to see how we can
convert decimal numbers to fractions. We know that $5.03 means 5 dollars and 3 cents. Since there are 100 cents in
one dollar,

3 cents means 3 of a dollar, so 0.03 = 3 .
100
100

We convert decimals to fractions by identifying the place value of the farthest right digit. In the decimal
in the hundredths place, so

100 is the denominator of the fraction equivalent to 0.03.

0.03, the 3 is

0.03 = 3
100
For our

$5.03 lunch, we can write the decimal 5.03 as a mixed number.
5.03 = 5 3
100

Notice that when the number to the left of the decimal is zero, we get a proper fraction. When the number to the left of
the decimal is not zero, we get a mixed number.

414

Chapter 5 Decimals

HOW TO : : CONVERT A DECIMAL NUMBER TO A FRACTION OR MIXED NUMBER.
Step 1.

Look at the number to the left of the decimal.
◦ If it is zero, the decimal converts to a proper fraction.
◦ If it is not zero, the decimal converts to a mixed number.
▪ Write the whole number.

Step 2.

Determine the place value of the final digit.

Step 3.

Write the fraction.
◦ numerator—the ‘numbers’ to the right of the decimal point
◦ denominator—the place value corresponding to the final digit

Step 4.

Simplify the fraction, if possible.

EXAMPLE 5.4
Write each of the following decimal numbers as a fraction or a mixed number:

ⓐ 4.09 ⓑ 3.7 ⓒ −0.286

Order Decimals
Which is larger,

0.04 or 0.40 ?

If you think of this as money, you know that

$0.40 (forty cents) is greater than $0.04 (four cents). So,
0.40 > 0.04

In previous chapters, we used the number line to order numbers.

a < b ‘a is less than b’ when a is to the left of b on the number line
a > b ‘a is greater than b’ when a is to the right of b on the number line
Where are

0.04 and 0.40 located on the number line?

We see that

0.40 is to the right of 0.04. So we know 0.40 > 0.04.

0.31 compare to 0.308 ? This doesn’t translate into money to make the comparison easy. But if we convert
0.31 and 0.308 to fractions, we can tell which is larger.

If two decimals have the same value, they are said to be equivalent decimals.

0.31 = 0.310
We say

0.31 and 0.310 are equivalent decimals.

Equivalent Decimals
Two decimals are equivalent decimals if they convert to equivalent fractions.
Remember, writing zeros at the end of a decimal does not change its value.

HOW TO : : ORDER DECIMALS.
Step 1.

Check to see if both numbers have the same number of decimal places. If not, write zeros at
the end of the one with fewer digits to make them match.

Step 2.

Compare the numbers to the right of the decimal point as if they were whole numbers.

Step 3.

Order the numbers using the appropriate inequality sign.

EXAMPLE 5.7
Order the following decimals using

ⓐ 0.64 __0.6

< or >:

ⓑ 0.83 __0.803

418

Chapter 5 Decimals

Solution

ⓐ
0.64 __0.6
Check to see if both numbers have the same number of decimal places. They do not, so
write one zero at the right of 0.6.

0.64 __0.60

Compare the numbers to the right of the decimal point as if they were whole numbers.

64 > 60
0.64 > 0.60

Order the numbers using the appropriate inequality sign.

0.64 > 0.6

ⓑ
0.83 __0.803
Check to see if both numbers have the same number of decimal places. They do not, so
write one zero at the right of 0.83.

0.830 __0.803

Compare the numbers to the right of the decimal point as if they were whole numbers.

830 > 803
0.830 > 0.803

Order the numbers using the appropriate inequality sign.

TRY IT : : 5.13

When we order negative decimals, it is important to remember how to order negative integers. Recall that larger numbers
are to the right on the number line. For example, because −2 lies to the right of −3 on the number line, we know that

−2 > −3. Similarly, smaller numbers lie to the left on the number line. For example, because −9 lies to the left of −6
−9 < −6.

Round Decimals
In the United States, gasoline prices are usually written with the decimal part as thousandths of a dollar. For example, a
gas station might post the price of unleaded gas at $3.279 per gallon. But if you were to buy exactly one gallon of gas
at this price, you would pay

$3.28 , because the final price would be rounded to the nearest cent. In Whole Numbers,

we saw that we round numbers to get an approximate value when the exact value is not needed. Suppose we wanted to
round $2.72 to the nearest dollar. Is it closer to $2 or to $3 ? What if we wanted to round $2.72 to the nearest ten
cents; is it closer to

Figure 5.4

$2.70 or to $2.80 ? The number lines in Figure 5.4 can help us answer those questions.

ⓐ We see that 2.72

ⓑ We see that 2.72

is closer to

is closer to

2.70

than

3 than to 2. So, 2.72 rounded to the nearest whole number is 3.
2.80. So we say that 2.72 rounded to the nearest tenth is 2.7.

Can we round decimals without number lines? Yes! We use a method based on the one we used to round whole numbers.

HOW TO : : ROUND A DECIMAL.
Step 1.

Locate the given place value and mark it with an arrow.

Step 2.

Underline the digit to the right of the given place value.

Step 3.

Is this digit greater than or equal to
◦ Yes - add

5?

1 to the digit in the given place value.

◦ No - do not change the digit in the given place value
Step 4.

Rewrite the number, removing all digits to the right of the given place value.

So, 18.379 rounded to the nearest tenth
is 18.4.

ⓑ Round 18.379 to the nearest whole number.

Locate the ones place and mark it with an arrow.

Underline the digit to the right of the ones place.

Since 3 is not greater than or equal to 5, do not add 1 to

Add and Subtract Decimals
Let’s take one more look at the lunch order from the start of Decimals, this time noticing how the numbers were added
together.

All three items (sandwich, water, tax) were priced in dollars and cents, so we lined up the dollars under the dollars and
the cents under the cents, with the decimal points lined up between them. Then we just added each column, as if we were
adding whole numbers. By lining up decimals this way, we can add or subtract the corresponding place values just as we
did with whole numbers.

HOW TO : : ADD OR SUBTRACT DECIMALS.
Step 1.

Write the numbers vertically so the decimal points line up.

Step 2.

Use zeros as place holders, as needed.

Step 3.

Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Then place the decimal in the
answer under the decimal points in the given numbers.

Solution
If we subtract 7.4 from 2.51, the answer will be negative since 7.4 > 2.51. To subtract easily, we can subtract 2.51
from 7.4. Then we will place the negative sign in the result.
2.51 − 7.4
Write the numbers vertically so the decimal points line up.
Place zero after the 4 in 7.4 as a place holder, so that both numbers have two
decimal places.
Subtract and place the decimal in the answer.
Remember that we are really subtracting 2.51 − 7.4 so the answer is negative.

Multiply Decimals
Multiplying decimals is very much like multiplying whole numbers—we just have to determine where to place the decimal
point. The procedure for multiplying decimals will make sense if we first review multiplying fractions.
Do you remember how to multiply fractions? To multiply fractions, you multiply the numerators and then multiply the

denominators.
So let’s see what we would get as the product of decimals by converting them to fractions first. We will do two examples
side-by-side in Table 5.3. Look for a pattern.

A

B

(0.3)(0.7)

(0.2)(0.46)

Table 5.3

There is a pattern that we can use. In A, we multiplied two numbers that each had one decimal place, and the product had
two decimal places. In B, we multiplied a number with one decimal place by a number with two decimal places, and the
product had three decimal places.
How many decimal places would you expect for the product of

(0.01)(0.004) ? If you said “five”, you recognized the

pattern. When we multiply two numbers with decimals, we count all the decimal places in the factors—in this case two
plus three—to get the number of decimal places in the product—in this case five.

Once we know how to determine the number of digits after the decimal point, we can multiply decimal numbers without
converting them to fractions first. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum of the number of decimal places
in the factors.
The rules for multiplying positive and negative numbers apply to decimals, too, of course.
Multiplying Two Numbers
When multiplying two numbers,
• if their signs are the same, the product is positive.
• if their signs are different, the product is negative.
When you multiply signed decimals, first determine the sign of the product and then multiply as if the numbers were both
positive. Finally, write the product with the appropriate sign.

HOW TO : : MULTIPLY DECIMAL NUMBERS.
Step 1.

Determine the sign of the product.

Step 2.

Write the numbers in vertical format, lining up the numbers on the right.

Step 3.

Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal points.

Step 4.

Place the decimal point. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum of the number
of decimal places in the factors. If needed, use zeros as placeholders.

Step 5.

Write the product with the appropriate sign.

EXAMPLE 5.15
Multiply:

(3.9)(4.075).

Multiply by Powers of 10
In many fields, especially in the sciences, it is common to multiply decimals by powers of

1.9436 by some powers of 10.

when we multiply

10. Let’s see what happens

Look at the results without the final zeros. Do you notice a pattern?

1.9436(10)
= 19.436
1.9436(100) = 194.36
1.9436(1000) = 1943.6
The number of places that the decimal point moved is the same as the number of zeros in the power of ten. Table 5.4
summarizes the results.

Multiply by

Number of zeros

2

2 places to the right

Table 5.4

We can use this pattern as a shortcut to multiply by powers of ten instead of multiplying using the vertical format. We can
count the zeros in the power of 10 and then move the decimal point that same of places to the right.
So, for example, to multiply

45.86 by 100, move the decimal point 2 places to the right.

Sometimes when we need to move the decimal point, there are not enough decimal places. In that case, we use zeros as
placeholders. For example, let’s multiply 2.4 by 100. We need to move the decimal point 2 places to the right. Since
there is only one digit to the right of the decimal point, we must write a

0 in the hundredths place.

HOW TO : : MULTIPLY A DECIMAL BY A POWER OF 10.
Step 1.

Move the decimal point to the right the same number of places as the number of zeros in the
power of 10.

Step 2.

Write zeros at the end of the number as placeholders if needed.

Divide Decimals
Just as with multiplication, division of decimals is very much like dividing whole numbers. We just have to figure out where
the decimal point must be placed.
To understand decimal division, let’s consider the multiplication problem

(0.2)(4) = 0.8
Remember, a multiplication problem can be rephrased as a division problem. So we can write

0.8 ÷ 4 = 0.2
We can think of this as “If we divide 8 tenths into four groups, how many are in each group?” Figure 5.5 shows that there
are four groups of two-tenths in eight-tenths. So 0.8 ÷ 4 = 0.2.

434

Chapter 5 Decimals

Figure 5.5

Using long division notation, we would write

Notice that the decimal point in the quotient is directly above the decimal point in the dividend.
To divide a decimal by a whole number, we place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend
and then divide as usual. Sometimes we need to use extra zeros at the end of the dividend to keep dividing until there is
no remainder.

HOW TO : : DIVIDE A DECIMAL BY A WHOLE NUMBER.
Step 1.

Write as long division, placing the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the
dividend.

Step 2.

Divide as usual.

EXAMPLE 5.19
Divide:

0.12 ÷ 3.

Solution
0.12 ÷ 3
Write as long division, placing the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point
in the dividend.
Divide as usual. Since 3 does not go into 0 or 1 we use zeros as placeholders.

0.12 ÷ 3 = 0.04

In everyday life, we divide whole numbers into decimals—money—to find the price of one item. For example, suppose a
case of 24 water bottles cost $3.99. To find the price per water bottle, we would divide $3.99 by 24, and round the
answer to the nearest cent (hundredth).
EXAMPLE 5.20
Divide:

$3.99 ÷ 24.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col30939/1.6

Chapter 5 Decimals

435

Solution
$3.99 ÷ 24
Place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend.

Divide as usual. When do we stop? Since this division involves money, we round it to
the nearest cent (hundredth). To do this, we must carry the division to the
thousandths place.

$0.166 ≈ $0.17

Round to the nearest cent.

$3.99 ÷ 24 ≈ $0.17
This means the price per bottle is

17 cents.

Divide a Decimal by Another Decimal
So far, we have divided a decimal by a whole number. What happens when we divide a decimal by another decimal? Let’s
look at the same multiplication problem we looked at earlier, but in a different way.

(0.2)(4) = 0.8
Remember, again, that a multiplication problem can be rephrased as a division problem. This time we ask, “How many
times does 0.2 go into 0.8?” Because (0.2)(4) = 0.8, we can say that 0.2 goes into 0.8 four times. This means that

0.8 divided by 0.2 is 4.

0.8 ÷ 0.2 = 4

We would get the same answer,
division problem as a fraction.

4, if we divide 8 by 2, both whole numbers. Why is this so? Let’s think about the
0.8
0.2
(0.8)10
(0.2)10
8
2
4

We multiplied the numerator and denominator by

10 and ended up just dividing 8 by 4. To divide decimals, we multiply

both the numerator and denominator by the same power of 10 to make the denominator a whole number. Because of
the Equivalent Fractions Property, we haven’t changed the value of the fraction. The effect is to move the decimal points
in the numerator and denominator the same number of places to the right.
We use the rules for dividing positive and negative numbers with decimals, too. When dividing signed decimals, first
determine the sign of the quotient and then divide as if the numbers were both positive. Finally, write the quotient with

the appropriate sign.
It may help to review the vocabulary for division:

HOW TO : : DIVIDE DECIMAL NUMBERS.
Step 1.

Determine the sign of the quotient.

Step 2.

Make the divisor a whole number by moving the decimal point all the way to the right. Move
the decimal point in the dividend the same number of places to the right, writing zeros as
needed.

Step 3.

Divide. Place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend.

Step 4.

Write the quotient with the appropriate sign.

EXAMPLE 5.21
Divide:

−2.89 ÷ (3.4).

Solution
Determine the sign of the quotient.

The quotient will be
negative.

Make the divisor the whole number by 'moving' the decimal point all the
way to the right. 'Move' the decimal point in the dividend the same number
of places to the right.

Divide. Place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in
the dividend. Add zeros as needed until the remainder is zero.

Write the quotient with the appropriate sign.

Convert Fractions to Decimals
In Decimals, we learned to convert decimals to fractions. Now we will do the reverse—convert fractions to decimals.
Remember that the fraction bar indicates division. So

4 can be written 4 ÷ 5 or 5 4. This means that we can convert a
5

fraction to a decimal by treating it as a division problem.
Convert a Fraction to a Decimal

To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator of the fraction by the denominator of the fraction.
EXAMPLE 5.28
Write the fraction

3 as a decimal.

Solution
A fraction bar means division, so we can write the fraction 3 using
division.

Find the Circumference and Area of Circles
The properties of circles have been studied for over

2,000 years. All circles have exactly the same shape, but their sizes

are affected by the length of the radius, a line segment from the center to any point on the circle. A line segment that
passes through a circle’s center connecting two points on the circle is called a diameter. The diameter is twice as long as
the radius. See Figure 5.6.
The size of a circle can be measured in two ways. The distance around a circle is called its circumference.

452

Chapter 5 Decimals

Figure 5.6

Archimedes discovered that for circles of all different sizes, dividing the circumference by the diameter always gives the
same number. The value of this number is pi, symbolized by Greek letter π (pronounced pie). However, the exact value
of π cannot be calculated since the decimal never ends or repeats (we will learn more about numbers like this in The
Properties of Real Numbers.)
MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity Pi Lab will help you develop a better understanding of pi.

π in the answer. We can get an approximate
3.14 as the value of π. We use the symbol ≈ to show that the result is approximate, not exact.

If we want the exact circumference or area of a circle, we leave the symbol

Properties of Circles

r is the length of the radius.
d is the length of the diameter.
The circumference is 2πr.

The area is πr .
A = πr 2
Since the diameter is twice the radius, another way to find the circumference is to use the formula

10 inches. To calculate the area, we would evaluate the
r = 10 inches and leave the answer in terms of π.

Suppose we want to find the exact area of a circle of radius

To approximate the area, we would substitute

π ≈ 3.14.

we have a circle with radius given as a fraction, we can substitute 22 for π instead of 3.14. And, since 22 is also an

Determine Whether a Decimal is a Solution of an Equation
Solving equations with decimals is important in our everyday lives because money is usually written with decimals. When
applications involve money, such as shopping for yourself, making your family’s budget, or planning for the future of your
business, you’ll be solving equations with decimals.
Now that we’ve worked with decimals, we are ready to find solutions to equations involving decimals. The steps we take
to determine whether a number is a solution to an equation are the same whether the solution is a whole number, an
integer, a fraction, or a decimal. We’ll list these steps here again for easy reference.

HOW TO : : DETERMINE WHETHER A NUMBER IS A SOLUTION TO AN EQUATION.
Step 1.

Substitute the number for the variable in the equation.

Step 2.

Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation.

Step 3.

Determine whether the resulting equation is true.
◦ If so, the number is a solution.
◦ If not, the number is not a solution.

EXAMPLE 5.40
Determine whether each of the following is a solution of

ⓐ x = 1 ⓑ x = −0.8 ⓒ x = 2.2

x − 0.7 = 1.5:

Solve Equations with Decimals
In previous chapters, we solved equations using the Properties of Equality. We will use these same properties to solve
equations with decimals.

One application of decimals that arises often is finding the average of a set of numbers. What do you think of when you
hear the word average? Is it your grade point average, the average rent for an apartment in your city, the batting average
of a player on your favorite baseball team? The average is a typical value in a set of numerical data. Calculating an average
sometimes involves working with decimal numbers. In this section, we will look at three different ways to calculate an
average.

Calculate the Mean of a Set of Numbers
The mean is often called the arithmetic average. It is computed by dividing the sum of the values by the number of values.
Students want to know the mean of their test scores. Climatologists report that the mean temperature has, or has not,
changed. City planners are interested in the mean household size.
Suppose Ethan’s first three test scores were

Dora is in the middle of the group. Her height,

65″, is the median of the girls’ heights. Half of the heights are less than

or equal to Dora’s height, and half are greater than or equal. The median is the middle value.

Median
The median of a set of data values is the middle value.
• Half the data values are less than or equal to the median.
• Half the data values are greater than or equal to the median.
What if Carmen, the pianist, joins the singing group on stage? Carmen is
between Bianca and Dora. Now the data set looks like this:

62 inches tall, so she fits in the height order

59, 60, 62, 65, 68, 70
There is no single middle value. The heights of the six girls can be divided into two equal parts.

Statisticians have agreed that in cases like this the median is the mean of the two values closest to the middle. So the
median is the mean of

62 and 65, 62 + 65 . The median height is 63.5 inches.
2

Notice that when the number of girls was

5, the median was the third height, but when the number of girls was 6, the

median was the mean of the third and fourth heights. In general, when the number of values is odd, the median will be
the one value in the middle, but when the number is even, the median is the mean of the two middle values.

Identify the Mode of a Set of Numbers
The average is one number in a set of numbers that is somehow typical of the whole set of numbers. The mean and
median are both often called the average. Yes, it can be confusing when the word average refers to two different numbers,
the mean and the median! In fact, there is a third number that is also an average. This average is the mode. The mode
of a set of numbers is the number that occurs the most. The frequency, is the number of times a number occurs. So the
mode of a set of numbers is the number with the highest frequency.
Mode
The mode of a set of numbers is the number with the highest frequency.
Suppose Jolene kept track of the number of miles she ran since the start of the month, as shown in Figure 5.7.

If we list the numbers in order it is easier to identify the one with the highest frequency.

Some data sets do not have a mode because no value appears more than any other. And some data sets have more than
one mode. In a given set, if two or more data values have the same highest frequency, we say they are all modes.

Use the Basic Definition of Probability
The probability of an event tells us how likely that event is to occur. We usually write probabilities as fractions or decimals.
For example, picture a fruit bowl that contains five pieces of fruit - three bananas and two apples.
If you want to choose one piece of fruit to eat for a snack and don’t care what it is, there is a

3 probability you will choose
5

a banana, because there are three bananas out of the total of five pieces of fruit. The probability of an event is the number
of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

Probability
The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes possible.

Probability = number of favorable outcomes
total number of outcomes
Converting the fraction

3 to a decimal, we would say there is a 0.6 probability of choosing a banana.
5
Probability of choosing a banana = 3
5
Probability of choosing a banana = 0.6

This basic definition of probability assumes that all the outcomes are equally likely to occur. If you study probabilities in a
later math class, you’ll learn about several other ways to calculate probabilities.
EXAMPLE 5.56
The ski club is holding a raffle to raise money. They sold 100 tickets. All of the tickets are placed in a jar. One ticket will be

Write a Ratio as a Fraction
When you apply for a mortgage, the loan officer will compare your total debt to your total income to decide if you qualify
for the loan. This comparison is called the debt-to-income ratio. A ratio compares two quantities that are measured with
the same unit. If we compare a and b , the ratio is written as a to b, a , or a:b.

In this section, we will use the fraction notation. When a ratio is written in fraction form, the fraction should be simplified.
If it is an improper fraction, we do not change it to a mixed number. Because a ratio compares two quantities, we would
leave a ratio as

4 instead of simplifying it to 4 so that we can see the two parts of the ratio.

Ratios Involving Decimals
We will often work with ratios of decimals, especially when we have ratios involving money. In these cases, we can
eliminate the decimals by using the Equivalent Fractions Property to convert the ratio to a fraction with whole numbers in
the numerator and denominator.

0.8 to 0.05. We can write it as a fraction with decimals and then multiply the numerator
100 to eliminate the decimals.

Applications of Ratios
One real-world application of ratios that affects many people involves measuring cholesterol in blood. The ratio of total
cholesterol to HDL cholesterol is one way doctors assess a person's overall health. A ratio of less than 5 to 1 is
considered good.
EXAMPLE 5.61
Hector's total cholesterol is

249 mg/dl and his HDL cholesterol is 39 mg/dl. ⓐ Find the ratio of his total cholesterol to

his HDL cholesterol. ⓑ Assuming that a ratio less than

5 to 1 is considered good, what would you suggest to Hector?

Solution

ⓐ

First, write the words that express the ratio. We want to know the ratio of Hector's total cholesterol to his HDL
cholesterol.

Ratios of Two Measurements in Different Units
To find the ratio of two measurements, we must make sure the quantities have been measured with the same unit. If the
measurements are not in the same units, we must first convert them to the same units.
We know that to simplify a fraction, we divide out common factors. Similarly in a ratio of measurements, we divide out the
common unit.
EXAMPLE 5.62
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Guidelines for wheel chair ramps require a maximum vertical rise of
every

1 foot of horizontal run. What is the ratio of the rise to the run?

1 inch for

Solution
In a ratio, the measurements must be in the same units. We can change feet to inches, or inches to feet. It is usually easier
to convert to the smaller unit, since this avoids introducing more fractions into the problem.
Write the words that express the ratio.

Ratio of the rise to the run
Write the ratio as a fraction.

Write a Rate as a Fraction
Frequently we want to compare two different types of measurements, such as miles to gallons. To make this comparison,
we use a rate. Examples of rates are 120 miles in 2 hours, 160 words in 4 minutes, and $5 dollars per 64 ounces.
Rate
A rate compares two quantities of different units. A rate is usually written as a fraction.
When writing a fraction as a rate, we put the first given amount with its units in the numerator and the second amount
with its units in the denominator. When rates are simplified, the units remain in the numerator and denominator.
EXAMPLE 5.63
Bob drove his car

525 miles in 9 hours. Write this rate as a fraction.

Solution
525 miles in 9 hours
Write as a fraction, with 525 miles in the numerator and 9 hours in the
denominator.

525 miles
9 hours
175 miles
3 hours

So

525 miles in 9 hours is equivalent to 175 miles .

Unit Rate

A unit rate is a rate with denominator of

1 unit.

68 miles per hour
68 miles in 1 hour. We would write this rate as 68 miles/hour (read 68 miles per hour). The
common abbreviation for this is 68 mph. Note that when no number is written before a unit, it is assumed to be 1.
Unit rates are very common in our lives. For example, when we say that we are driving at a speed of
we mean that we travel
So

68 miles/hour really means 68 miles/1 hour.

Two rates we often use when driving can be written in different forms, as shown:

Another example of unit rate that you may already know about is hourly pay rate. It is usually expressed as the amount
of money earned for one hour of work. For example, if you are paid $12.50 for each hour you work, you could write that
your hourly (unit) pay rate is

$12.50/hour (read $12.50 per hour.)

To convert a rate to a unit rate, we divide the numerator by the denominator. This gives us a denominator of
EXAMPLE 5.64
Anita was paid

$384 last week for working 32 hours. What is Anita’s hourly pay rate?

Solution
Start with a rate of dollars to hours. Then divide.

Find Unit Price
Sometimes we buy common household items ‘in bulk’, where several items are packaged together and sold for one price.
To compare the prices of different sized packages, we need to find the unit price. To find the unit price, divide the total
price by the number of items. A unit price is a unit rate for one item.
Unit price
A unit price is a unit rate that gives the price of one item.
EXAMPLE 5.66
The grocery store charges

$3.99 for a case of 24 bottles of water. What is the unit price?

What are we asked to find? We are asked to find the unit price, which is the price per bottle.

list the unit price of each item on the shelves.
EXAMPLE 5.67
Paul is shopping for laundry detergent. At the grocery store, the liquid detergent is priced at
laundry and the same brand of powder detergent is priced at

$15.99 for 80 loads.

Which is the better buy, the liquid or the powder detergent?

Simplify Expressions with Square Roots
To start this section, we need to review some important vocabulary and notation.
Remember that when a number
For example,
We call

n is multiplied by itself, we can write this as n 2, which we read aloud as “n squared.”

8 2 is read as “8 squared.”

64 the square of 8 because 8 2 = 64. Similarly, 121 is the square of 11, because 11 2 = 121.

Square of a Number
If

n 2 = m, then m is the square of n.

Modeling Squares
Do you know why we use the word square? If we construct a square with three tiles on each side, the total number of tiles
would be nine.

This is why we say that the square of three is nine.

32 = 9
The number

9 is called a perfect square because it is the square of a whole number.

Perfect Squares
A perfect square is the square of a whole number.
What happens when you square a negative number?

(−8) 2 = (−8)(−8)
= 64
When we multiply two negative numbers, the product is always positive. So, the square of a negative number is always
positive.
The chart shows the squares of the negative integers from

−1 to −15.

Did you notice that these squares are the same as the squares of the positive numbers?

Square Roots
Sometimes we will need to look at the relationship between numbers and their squares in reverse. Because
we say

100 is the square of 10. We can also say that 10 is a square root of 100.

10 2 = 100,

n = m, then n is a square root of m.

Notice

(−10) 2 = 100 also, so −10 is also a square root of 100. Therefore, both 10 and −10 are square roots of 100.

So, every positive number has two square roots: one positive and one negative.

Square Root of a Negative Number
Can we simplify

−25 ? Is there a number whose square is −25 ?
( ) 2 = −25 ?

None of the numbers that we have dealt with so far have a square that is −25. Why? Any positive number squared is
positive, and any negative number squared is also positive. In the next chapter we will see that all the numbers we work
with are called the real numbers. So we say there is no real number equal to −25. If we are asked to find the square
root of any negative number, we say that the solution is not a real number.
EXAMPLE 5.71
Simplify: ⓐ

−169

ⓑ − 121.

Solution

ⓐ There is no real number whose square is −169.

Therefore,

−169 is not a real number.

ⓑ The negative is in front of the radical sign, so we find the opposite of the square root of 121.

Square Roots and the Order of Operations
When using the order of operations to simplify an expression that has square roots, we treat the radical sign as a grouping
symbol. We simplify any expressions under the radical sign before performing other operations.
EXAMPLE 5.72
Simplify: ⓐ

25 + 144

ⓑ 25 + 144.

Solution

ⓐ Use the order of operations.
25 + 144
Simplify each radical.

ⓑ 64 + 225.

Notice the different answers in parts ⓐ and ⓑ of Example 5.72. It is important to follow the order of operations correctly.

In ⓐ, we took each square root first and then added them. In ⓑ, we added under the radical sign first and then found the
square root.

Estimate Square Roots
So far we have only worked with square roots of perfect squares. The square roots of other numbers are not whole
numbers.

We might conclude that the square roots of numbers between

4 and 9 will be between 2 and 3, and they will not be

whole numbers. Based on the pattern in the table above, we could say that
symbols, we write

5 is between 2 and 3. Using inequality

Approximate Square Roots with a Calculator
There are mathematical methods to approximate square roots, but it is much more convenient to use a calculator to
find square roots. Find the
or x key on your calculator. You will to use this key to approximate square roots. When
you use your calculator to find the square root of a number that is not a perfect square, the answer that you see is not
the exact number. It is an approximation, to the number of digits shown on your calculator’s display. The symbol for an
approximation is ≈ and it is read approximately.

( ? ) 2 = 9x 2
(3x) 2 = 9x 2

by squaring the length of its sides. Now we can find the length of the sides of a square if we are given the area, by finding
the square root of the area.

Square Roots and Accident Investigations
Police officers investigating car accidents measure the length of the skid marks on the pavement. Then they use square
roots to determine the speed, in miles per hour, a car was going before applying the brakes. According to some formulas,
if the length of the skid marks is d feet, then the speed of the car can be found by evaluating 24d.

KEY CONCEPTS
5.1 Decimals
• Name a decimal number.
Step 1. Name the number to the left of the decimal point.
Step 2. Write “and” for the decimal point.
Step 3. Name the “number” part to the right of the decimal point as if it were a whole number.
Step 4. Name the decimal place of the last digit.
• Write a decimal number from its name.
Step 1. Look for the word “and”—it locates the decimal point.
Place a decimal point under the word “and.” Translate the words before “and” into the whole number and
place it to the left of the decimal point.
If there is no “and,” write a “0” with a decimal point to its right.
Step 2. Mark the number of decimal places needed to the right of the decimal point by noting the place value
indicated by the last word.
Step 3. Translate the words after “and” into the number to the right of the decimal point. Write the number in the
spaces—putting the final digit in the last place.
Step 4. Fill in zeros for place holders as needed.
• Convert a decimal number to a fraction or mixed number.
Step 1. Look at the number to the left of the decimal.
If it is zero, the decimal converts to a proper fraction.
If it is not zero, the decimal converts to a mixed number.
Write the whole number.
Step 2. Determine the place value of the final digit.
Step 3. Write the fraction. numerator—the ‘numbers’ to the right of the decimal point denominator—the place
value corresponding to the final digit
Step 4. Simplify the fraction, if possible.
• Order decimals.

508

Chapter 5 Decimals

Step 1. Check to see if both numbers have the same number of decimal places. If not, write zeros at the end of
the one with fewer digits to make them match.
Step 2. Compare the numbers to the right of the decimal point as if they were whole numbers.
Step 3. Order the numbers using the appropriate inequality sign.
• Round a decimal.
Step 1. Locate the given place value and mark it with an arrow.
Step 2. Underline the digit to the right of the given place value.
Step 3. Is this digit greater than or equal to 5?
Yes - add 1 to the digit in the given place value.
No - do not change the digit in the given place value
Step 4. Rewrite the number, removing all digits to the right of the given place value.

5.2 Decimal Operations
• Add or subtract decimals.
Step 1. Write the numbers vertically so the decimal points line up.
Step 2. Use zeros as place holders, as needed.
Step 3. Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Then place the decimal in the answer under
the decimal points in the given numbers.
• Multiply decimal numbers.
Step 1. Determine the sign of the product.
Step 2. Write the numbers in vertical format, lining up the numbers on the right.
Step 3. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal points.
Step 4. Place the decimal point. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum of the number of decimal
places in the factors. If needed, use zeros as placeholders.
Step 5. Write the product with the appropriate sign.
• Multiply a decimal by a power of 10.
Step 1. Move the decimal point to the right the same number of places as the number of zeros in the power of 10.
Step 2. Write zeros at the end of the number as placeholders if needed.
• Divide a decimal by a whole number.
Step 1. Write as long division, placing the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend.
Step 2. Divide as usual.
• Divide decimal numbers.
Step 1. Determine the sign of the quotient.
Step 2. Make the divisor a whole number by moving the decimal point all the way to the right. Move the decimal
point in the dividend the same number of places to the right, writing zeros as needed.
Step 3. Divide. Place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend.
Step 4. Write the quotient with the appropriate sign.
• Strategy for Applications
Step 1. Identify what you are asked to find.
Step 2. Write a phrase that gives the information to find it.
Step 3. Translate the phrase to an expression.
Step 4. Simplify the expression.
Step 5. Answer the question with a complete sentence.

Introduction
When you deposit money in a savings account at a bank, it earns additional money. Figuring out how your money will
grow involves understanding and applying concepts of percents. In this chapter, we will find out what percents are and
how we can use them to solve problems.

Use the Definition of Percent
How many cents are in one dollar? There are 100 cents in a dollar. How many years are in a century? There are 100
years in a century. Does this give you a clue about what the word “percent” means? It is really two words, “per cent,”
and means per one hundred. A percent is a ratio whose denominator is 100. We use the percent symbol %, to show
percent.

Sometimes when changing a fraction to a decimal, the division continues for many decimal places and we will round off
the quotient. The number of decimal places we round to will depend on the situation. If the decimal involves money, we
round to the hundredths place. For most other cases in this book we will round the number to the nearest thousandth, so
the percent will be rounded to the nearest tenth.

Translate and Solve Basic Percent Equations
We will solve percent equations by using the methods we used to solve equations with fractions or decimals. In the past,
you may have solved percent problems by setting them up as proportions. That was the best method available when you
did not have the tools of algebra. Now as a prealgebra student, you can translate word sentences into algebraic equations,
and then solve the equations.
We'll look at a common application of percent—tips to a server at a restaurant—to see how to set up a basic percent
application.
When Aolani and her friends ate dinner at a restaurant, the bill came to
amount would the tip be?
To solve this, we want to find what amount is

$80. They wanted to leave a 20% tip. What

20% of $80. The $80 is called the base. The amount of the tip would be

0.20(80), or $16 See Figure 6.6. To find the amount of the tip, we multiplied the percent by the base.

Solve Applications of Percent
Many applications of percent occur in our daily lives, such as tips, sales tax, discount, and interest. To solve these
applications we'll translate to a basic percent equation, just like those we solved in the previous examples in this section.
Once you translate the sentence into a percent equation, you know how to solve it.
We will update the strategy we used in our earlier applications to include equations now. Notice that we will translate a
sentence into an equation.

538

Chapter 6 Percents

HOW TO : : SOLVE AN APPLICATION
Step 1.

Identify what you are asked to find and choose a variable to represent it.

Step 2.

Write a sentence that gives the information to find it.

Step 3.

Translate the sentence into an equation.

Step 4.

Solve the equation using good algebra techniques.

Step 5.

Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.

Step 6.

Write a complete sentence that answers the question.

Now that we have the strategy to refer to, and have practiced solving basic percent equations, we are ready to solve
percent applications. Be sure to ask yourself if your final answer makes sense—since many of the applications we'll solve
involve everyday situations, you can rely on your own experience.
EXAMPLE 6.20
Dezohn and his girlfriend enjoyed a dinner at a restaurant, and the bill was

18% of the total bill, how much should the tip be?

$68.50. They want to leave an 18% tip. If

Solution
What are you asked to find?

the amount of the tip

Choose a variable to represent it.

Let t = amount of tip.

Write a sentence that give the information to find it.

The tip is 18% of the total bill.

Translate the sentence into an equation.
Multiply.
Check. Is this answer reasonable?
If we approximate the bill to $70 and the percent to 20%, we would
have a tip of $14.
So a tip of $12.33 seems reasonable.
The couple should leave a tip of

Find Percent Increase and Percent Decrease
People in the media often talk about how much an amount has increased or decreased over a certain period of time. They
usually express this increase or decrease as a percent.
To find the percent increase, first we find the amount of increase, which is the difference between the new amount and
the original amount. Then we find what percent the amount of increase is of the original amount.

HOW TO : : FIND PERCENT INCREASE.
Step 1. Find the amount of increase.
•

increase = new amount − original amount

Step 2. Find the percent increase as a percent of the original amount.

EXAMPLE 6.23

Finding the percent decrease is very similar to finding the percent increase, but now the amount of decrease is the
difference between the original amount and the final amount. Then we find what percent the amount of decrease is of
the original amount.

HOW TO : : FIND PERCENT DECREASE.
Step 1.

Find the amount of decrease.
◦

Step 2.

decrease = original amount − new amount

Find the percent decrease as a percent of the original amount.

price of an item. See Figure 6.7. The sales tax is determined by computing a percent of the purchase price.
To find the sales tax multiply the purchase price by the sales tax rate. Remember to convert the sales tax rate from a
percent to a decimal number. Once the sales tax is calculated, it is added to the purchase price. The result is the total
cost—this is what the customer pays.

Solve Commission Applications
Sales people often receive a commission, or percent of total sales, for their sales. Their income may be just the
commission they earn, or it may be their commission added to their hourly wages or salary. The commission they earn is
calculated as a certain percent of the price of each item they sell. That percent is called the rate of commission.
Commission
A commission is a percentage of total sales as determined by the rate of commission.

commission = rate of commission · total sales
To find the commission on a sale, multiply the rate of commission by the total sales. Just as we did for computing sales
tax, remember to first convert the rate of commission from a percent to a decimal.

Solve Discount Applications
Applications of discount are very common in retail settings Figure 6.8. When you buy an item on sale, the original price
of the item has been reduced by some dollar amount. The discount rate, usually given as a percent, is used to determine
the amount of the discount. To determine the amount of discount, we multiply the discount rate by the original price.

An amount of discount is a percent off the original price.

amount of discount = discount rate · original price
sale price = original price − discount
The sale price should always be less than the original price. In some cases, the amount of discount is a fixed dollar
amount. Then we just find the sale price by subtracting the amount of discount from the original price.

Solve Mark-up Applications
Applications of mark-up are very common in retail settings. The price a retailer pays for an item is called the wholesale
price. The retailer then adds a mark-up to the wholesale price to get the list price, the price he sells the item for. The
mark-up is usually calculated as a percent of the wholesale price. The percent is called the mark-up rate. To determine
the amount of mark-up, multiply the mark-up rate by the wholesale price. We summarize the mark-up model in the box
below.
Mark-up
The mark-up is the amount added to the wholesale price.

Use the Simple Interest Formula
Do you know that banks pay you to let them keep your money? The money you put in the bank is called the principal,
P, and the bank pays you interest, I. The interest is computed as a certain percent of the principal; called the rate
of interest, r. The rate of interest is usually expressed as a percent per year, and is calculated by using the decimal
equivalent of the percent. The variable for time, t, represents the number of years the money is left in the account.
Simple Interest

P, the principal, is invested for a period of t years at an annual interest rate r, the amount
I, earned is

Solve Simple Interest Applications
Applications with simple interest usually involve either investing money or borrowing money. To solve these applications,
we continue to use the same strategy for applications that we have used earlier in this chapter. The only difference is that
in place of translating to get an equation, we can use the simple interest formula.
We will start by solving a simple interest application to find the interest.

Use the Definition of Proportion
In the section on Ratios and Rates we saw some ways they are used in our daily lives. When two ratios or rates are equal,
the equation relating them is called a proportion.
Proportion
A proportion is an equation of the form

a = c , where b ≠ 0, d ≠ 0.
b d

The proportion states two ratios or rates are equal. The proportion is read
The equation
is to

8”.

“a is to b, as c is to d”.

1 = 4 is a proportion because the two fractions are equal. The proportion 1 = 4 is read “1 is to 2 as 4
2 8
2 8

If we compare quantities with units, we have to be sure we are comparing them in the right order. For example, in the
proportion

20 students = 60 students we compare the number of students to the number of teachers. We put students
1 teacher
3 teachers

in the numerators and teachers in the denominators.

But how do we know if an equation is a proportion with equivalent fractions if it contains fractions with larger numbers?

To determine if a proportion is true, we find the cross products of each proportion. To find the cross products, we multiply
each denominator with the opposite numerator (diagonally across the equal sign). The results are called a cross products
because of the cross formed. The cross products of a proportion are equal.

572

Chapter 6 Percents

Cross Products of a Proportion
For any proportion of the form

a = c , where b ≠ 0, d ≠ 0, its cross products are equal.
b d

Cross products can be used to test whether a proportion is true. To test whether an equation makes a proportion, we find
the cross products. If they are the equal, we have a proportion.

Determine whether each equation is a proportion:

ⓐ 49 = 12

Solution
To determine if the equation is a proportion, we find the cross products. If they are equal, the equation is a proportion.

ⓐ

Find the cross products.

28 ⋅ 4 = 112

Since the cross products are not equal,

9 ⋅ 12 = 108

28 · 4 ≠ 9 · 12, the equation is not a proportion.

ⓑ

Find the cross products.

15 ⋅ 17.5 = 262.5

Since the cross products are equal,

To solve a proportion containing a variable, we remember that the proportion is an equation. All of the techniques we
have used so far to solve equations still apply. In the next example, we will solve a proportion by multiplying by the Least
Common Denominator (LCD) using the Multiplication Property of Equality.

Solve Applications Using Proportions
The strategy for solving applications that we have used earlier in this chapter, also works for proportions, since
proportions are equations. When we set up the proportion, we must make sure the units are correct—the units in the
numerators match and the units in the denominators match.

Write Percent Equations As Proportions
Previously, we solved percent equations by applying the properties of equality we have used to solve equations
throughout this text. Some people prefer to solve percent equations by using the proportion method. The proportion
method for solving percent problems involves a percent proportion. A percent proportion is an equation where a percent
is equal to an equivalent ratio.
For example,

60% = 60 and we can simplify 60 = 3 . Since the equation 60 = 3 shows a percent equal to an
100
100 5
100 5

equivalent ratio, we call it a percent proportion. Using the vocabulary we used earlier:

amount = percent
100
base
3 = 60
5 100
Percent Proportion
The amount is to the base as the percent is to

100.
amount = percent
100
base

If we restate the problem in the words of a proportion, it may be easier to set up the proportion:

The amount is to the base as the percent is to one hundred.
We could also say:

6.3 Solve Sales Tax, Commission, and Discount Applications
• Sales Tax The sales tax is a percent of the purchase price.
◦

sales tax = tax rate ⋅ purchase price

◦

total cost = purchase price + sales tax

• Commission A commission is a percentage of total sales as determined by the rate of commission.

commission = rate of commission ⋅ original price

◦

• Discount An amount of discount is a percent off the original price, determined by the discount rate.
◦

amount of discount = discount rate ⋅ original price

◦

sale price = original price – discount

• Mark-up The mark-up is the amount added to the wholesale price, determined by the mark-up rate.
◦

amount of mark-up = mark-up rate wholesale price

◦

list price = wholesale price + mark up

6.4 Solve Simple Interest Applications

THE PROPERTIES OF REAL NUMBERS

Figure 7.1 Quiltmakers know that by rearranging the same basic blocks the resulting quilts can look very different. What happens
when we rearrange the numbers in an expression? Does the resulting value change? We will answer these questions in this chapter

Introduction
A quilt is formed by sewing many different pieces of fabric together. The pieces can vary in color, size, and shape. The
combinations of different kinds of pieces provide for an endless possibility of patterns. Much like the pieces of fabric,
mathematicians distinguish among different types of numbers. The kinds of numbers in an expression provide for an
endless possibility of outcomes. We have already described counting numbers, whole numbers, and integers. In this
chapter, we will learn about other types of numbers and their properties.

Identify Rational Numbers and Irrational Numbers
Congratulations! You have completed the first six chapters of this book! It's time to take stock of what you have done
so far in this course and think about what is ahead. You have learned how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide whole
numbers, fractions, integers, and decimals. You have become familiar with the language and symbols of algebra, and
have simplified and evaluated algebraic expressions. You have solved many different types of applications. You have
established a good solid foundation that you need so you can be successful in algebra.
In this chapter, we'll make sure your skills are firmly set. We'll take another look at the kinds of numbers we have worked
with in all previous chapters. We'll work with properties of numbers that will help you improve your number sense. And
we'll practice using them in ways that we'll use when we solve equations and complete other procedures in algebra.
We have already described numbers as counting numbers, whole numbers, and integers. Do you remember what the
difference is among these types of numbers?

counting numbers

1, 2, 3, 4…

whole numbers

0, 1, 2, 3, 4…

integers

…−3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4…

Rational Numbers
What type of numbers would you get if you started with all the integers and then included all the fractions? The numbers
you would have form the set of rational numbers. A rational number is a number that can be written as a ratio of two
integers.
Rational Numbers
A rational number is a number that can be written in the form

p
q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ o.

All fractions, both positive and negative, are rational numbers. A few examples are

4 , − 7 , 13 , and − 20
8 4
3
5
Each numerator and each denominator is an integer.
We need to look at all the numbers we have used so far and verify that they are rational. The definition of rational numbers
tells us that all fractions are rational. We will now look at the counting numbers, whole numbers, integers, and decimals
to make sure they are rational.
Are integers rational numbers? To decide if an integer is a rational number, we try to write it as a ratio of two integers. An
easy way to do this is to write it as a fraction with denominator one.

3=3
1

−8 = −8
1

0=0
1

Since any integer can be written as the ratio of two integers, all integers are rational numbers. Remember that all the
counting numbers and all the whole numbers are also integers, and so they, too, are rational.
What about decimals? Are they rational? Let's look at a few to see if we can write each of them as the ratio of two integers.
We've already seen that integers are rational numbers. The integer −8 could be written as the decimal −8.0. So, clearly,
some decimals are rational.
Think about the decimal
improper fraction,

7.3. Can we write it as a ratio of two integers? Because 7.3 means 7 3 , we can write it as an
10

73 . So 7.3 is the ratio of the integers 73 and 10. It is a rational number.
10

In general, any decimal that ends after a number of digits (such as

7.3 or −1.2684) is a rational number. We can use

the reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the place value of the last digit as the denominator when writing the decimal
as a fraction.

Let's look at the decimal form of the numbers we know are rational. We have seen that every integer is a rational number,
since a = a for any integer, a. We can also change any integer to a decimal by adding a decimal point and a zero.

Irrational Numbers
Are there any decimals that do not stop or repeat? Yes. The number π (the Greek letter pi, pronounced ‘pie’), which is
very important in describing circles, has a decimal form that does not stop or repeat.

π = 3.141592654.......
Similarly, the decimal representations of square roots of whole numbers that are not perfect squares never stop and
never repeat. For example,

5 = 2.236067978.....
A decimal that does not stop and does not repeat cannot be written as the ratio of integers. We call this kind of number
an irrational number.
Irrational Number
An irrational number is a number that cannot be written as the ratio of two integers. Its decimal form does not stop
and does not repeat.
Let's summarize a method we can use to determine whether a number is rational or irrational.
If the decimal form of a number
• stops or repeats, the number is rational.
• does not stop and does not repeat, the number is irrational.
EXAMPLE 7.2
Identify each of the following as rational or irrational:
–

ⓐ 0.583

ⓑ 0.475

ⓒ 3.605551275…

Solution
–

ⓐ 0.583
The bar above the

–

3 indicates that it repeats. Therefore, 0.583 is a repeating decimal, and is therefore a rational number.

ⓑ 0.475

This decimal stops after the

5 , so it is a rational number.

ⓒ 3.605551275…
The ellipsis

(…) means that this number does not stop. There is no repeating pattern of digits. Since the number doesn't

stop and doesn't repeat, it is irrational.

Let's think about square roots now. Square roots of perfect squares are always whole numbers, so they are rational. But
the decimal forms of square roots of numbers that are not perfect squares never stop and never repeat, so these square
roots are irrational.
EXAMPLE 7.3
Identify each of the following as rational or irrational:

ⓐ 36

ⓑ 44

Solution

ⓐ The number 36

is a perfect square, since

ⓑ Remember that 6 2 = 36
This means

and

6 2 = 36. So 36 = 6. Therefore 36 is rational.

7 2 = 49, so 44 is not a perfect square.

44 is irrational.

Classify Real Numbers
We have seen that all counting numbers are whole numbers, all whole numbers are integers, and all integers are rational
numbers. Irrational numbers are a separate category of their own. When we put together the rational numbers and the
irrational numbers, we get the set of real numbers.
Figure 7.2 illustrates how the number sets are related.

Figure 7.2 This diagram illustrates the relationships between the different types of real
numbers.

Real Numbers
Real numbers are numbers that are either rational or irrational.
Does the term “real numbers” seem strange to you? Are there any numbers that are not “real”, and, if so, what could they
be? For centuries, the only numbers people knew about were what we now call the real numbers. Then mathematicians
discovered the set of imaginary numbers. You won't encounter imaginary numbers in this course, but you will later on in
your studies of algebra.

64 is the square of 8 so − 64 = −8. So the integers are −7, 8, − 64.

−7 and 8 are integers. Also,

−7, 8, and − 64 are also rational. Rational numbers also include
fractions and decimals that terminate or repeat, so 14 and 5.9 are rational.

Self Check

ⓐ After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section.

ⓑ If most of your checks were:
…confidently. Congratulations! You have achieved the objectives in this section. Reflect on the study skills you used so that you
can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific.
…with some help. This must be addressed quickly because topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success.
In math, every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on.
Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math
tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved?
…no—I don’t get it! This is a warning sign and you must not ignore it. You should get help right away or you will quickly be
overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as you can to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan to get you
the help you need.

In the next few sections, we will take a look at the properties of real numbers. Many of these properties will describe
things you already know, but it will help to give names to the properties and define them formally. This way we’ll be able
to refer to them and use them as we solve equations in the next chapter.

Use the Commutative and Associative Properties
Think about adding two numbers, such as

5 and 3.
5+3
8

The results are the same.

3+5
8

5+3=3+5

Notice, the order in which we add does not matter. The same is true when multiplying

5·3
15
Again, the results are the same!

5 and 3.

3·5
15

5 · 3 = 3 · 5. The order in which we multiply does not matter.

These examples illustrate the commutative properties of addition and multiplication.
Commutative Properties
Commutative Property of Addition: if

a and b are real numbers, then
a+b=b+a

Commutative Property of Multiplication: if

a and b are real numbers, then
a·b = b·a

The commutative properties have to do with order. If you change the order of the numbers when adding or multiplying,
the result is the same.
EXAMPLE 7.5
Use the commutative properties to rewrite the following expressions:

604

Chapter 7 The Properties of Real Numbers

ⓐ −1 + 3 = _____

ⓑ 4 · 9 = _____

Solution

ⓐ
−1 + 3 = _____
Use the commutative property of addition to change the order.

−1 + 3 = 3 + (−1)

ⓑ
4 · 9 = _____
4·9 = 9·4

Use the commutative property of multiplication to change the order.

TRY IT : : 7.9

Use the commutative properties to rewrite the following:

ⓐ −4 + 7 = _____
TRY IT : : 7.10

ⓑ 6 · 12 = _____

Use the commutative properties to rewrite the following:

ⓐ 14 + (−2) = _____

ⓑ 3(−5) = _____

What about subtraction? Does order matter when we subtract numbers? Does

7−3
4

7 − 3 give the same result as 3 − 7 ?

3−7
−4

4 ≠ −4
The results are not the same. 7 − 3 ≠ 3 − 7
Since changing the order of the subtraction did not give the same result, we can say that subtraction is not commutative.
Let’s see what happens when we divide two numbers. Is division commutative?

12 ÷ 4
12
4
3

4 ÷ 12
4
12
1
3

3≠1
3
The results are not the same. So 12 ÷ 4 ≠ 4 ÷ 12
Since changing the order of the division did not give the same result, division is not commutative.
Addition and multiplication are commutative. Subtraction and division are not commutative.
Suppose you were asked to simplify this expression.

7+8+2
How would you do it and what would your answer be?
Some people would think

7 + 10 makes 17.

7 + 8 is 15 and then 15 + 2 is 17. Others might start with 8 + 2 makes 10 and then

Both ways give the same result, as shown in Figure 7.3. (Remember that parentheses are grouping symbols that indicate
which operations should be done first.)

Figure 7.3

When adding three numbers, changing the grouping of the numbers does not change the result. This is known as the
Associative Property of Addition.
The same principle holds true for multiplication as well. Suppose we want to find the value of the following expression:

5· 1 ·3
3
Changing the grouping of the numbers gives the same result, as shown in Figure 7.4.

Figure 7.4

When multiplying three numbers, changing the grouping of the numbers does not change the result. This is known as the
Associative Property of Multiplication.
If we multiply three numbers, changing the grouping does not affect the product.
You probably know this, but the terminology may be new to you. These examples illustrate the Associative Properties.
Associative Properties
Associative Property of Addition: if

a, b, and c are real numbers, then
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)

Associative Property of Multiplication: if

a, b, and c are real numbers, then
(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)

EXAMPLE 7.6
Use the associative properties to rewrite the following:

ⓐ (3 + 0.6) + 0.4 = __________

ⓑ ⎛⎝−4 · 25 ⎞⎠ · 15 = __________

Solution

ⓐ
(3 + 0.6) + 0.4 = __________
Change the grouping.
Notice that

(3 + 0.6) + 0.4 = 3 + (0.6 + 0.4)

0.6 + 0.4 is 1, so the addition will be easier if we group as shown on the right.

Besides using the associative properties to make calculations easier, we will often use it to simplify expressions with
variables.
EXAMPLE 7.7
Use the Associative Property of Multiplication to simplify:

6(3x).

Solution
6(3x)
(6 · 3)x

Change the grouping.

Evaluate Expressions using the Commutative and Associative Properties
The commutative and associative properties can make it easier to evaluate some algebraic expressions. Since order does
not matter when adding or multiplying three or more terms, we can rearrange and re-group terms to make our work
easier, as the next several examples illustrate.
EXAMPLE 7.8
Evaluate each expression when

ⓐ x + 0.37 + ( − x)

x = 7.

Simplify Expressions Using the Commutative and Associative Properties
When we have to simplify algebraic expressions, we can often make the work easier by applying the Commutative or

ⓑ
0. Likewise, part ⓑ

Associative Property first instead of automatically following the order of operations. Notice that in Example 7.8 part
was easier to simplify than part

ⓐ because the opposites were next to each other and their sum is

in Example 7.9 was easier, with the reciprocals grouped together, because their product is 1. In the next few examples,
we’ll use our number sense to look for ways to apply these properties to make our work easier.
EXAMPLE 7.10
Simplify:

−84n + (−73n) + 84n.

Solution
Notice the first and third terms are opposites, so we can use the commutative property of addition to reorder the terms.

−84n + (−73n) + 84n
Re-order the terms.
Add left to right.

−84n + 84n + (−73n)
0 + (−73n)
−73n

Add.

TRY IT : : 7.19

Simplify:

−27a + (−48a) + 27a.

TRY IT : : 7.20

Simplify:

39x + (−92x) + (−39x).

Now we will see how recognizing reciprocals is helpful. Before multiplying left to right, look for reciprocals—their product
is 1.

When adding and subtracting three or more terms involving decimals, look for terms that combine to give whole
numbers.
EXAMPLE 7.13
Simplify:

(6.47q + 9.99q) + 1.01q.

Solution
Notice that the sum of the second and third coefficients is a whole number.

(6.47q + 9.99q) + 1.01q
6.47q + (9.99q + 1.01q)

Change the grouping.

6.47q + (11.00q)

Add in the parentheses first.

99 cents and 1 cent. Do you

No matter what you are doing, it is always a good idea to think ahead. When simplifying an expression, think about what
your steps will be. The next example will show you how using the Associative Property of Multiplication can make your
work easier if you plan ahead.
EXAMPLE 7.14
Simplify the expression:

⎡
⎣

1.67(8)⎤⎦(0.25).

Solution
(8)(0.25) is easier than multiplying 1.67(8) because it gives a whole number. (Think about
having 8 quarters—that makes $2.)
Notice that multiplying

⎡
⎣

1.67(8)⎤⎦(0.25)

1.67⎡⎣(8)(0.25)⎤⎦

Regroup.

a, b, c are real numbers, then
a(b + c) = ab + ac

Back to our friends at the movies, we could show the math steps we take to find the total amount of money they need like
this:

In algebra, we use the Distributive Property to remove parentheses as we simplify expressions. For example, if we are
asked to simplify the expression 3(x + 4), the order of operations says to work in the parentheses first. But we cannot
add

x and 4, since they are not like terms. So we use the Distributive Property, as shown in Example 7.19.

EXAMPLE 7.17
Simplify:

3(x + 4).

Solution
3(x + 4)
Distribute.

3·x + 3·4

Multiply.

3x + 12

TRY IT : : 7.33

Simplify:

4(x + 2).

TRY IT : : 7.34

Simplify:

6(x + 7).

Some students find it helpful to draw in arrows to remind them how to use the Distributive Property. Then the first step
in Example 7.17 would look like this:

EXAMPLE 7.18
Simplify:

6(5y + 1).

Solution

Distribute.
Multiply.

TRY IT : : 7.35

Simplify:

9(3y + 8).

TRY IT : : 7.36

Simplify:

The distributive property can be used to simplify expressions that look slightly different from
other forms.

Solution

Distribute.
Multiply.
Notice that we wrote m · 4 as 4m. We can do this because of the Commutative Property of Multiplication. When a term is
the product of a number and a variable, we write the number first.

Remember that we can always check division with the related multiplication fact. So, we know that

In this section we will see how to convert among different types of units, such as feet to miles or kilograms to pounds. The
basic idea in all of the unit conversions will be to use a form of 1, the multiplicative identity, to change the units but not
the value of a quantity.

Make Unit Conversions in the U.S. System
There are two systems of measurement commonly used around the world. Most countries use the metric system. The
United States uses a different system of measurement, usually called the U.S. system. We will look at the U.S. system first.
The U.S. system of measurement uses units of inch, foot, yard, and mile to measure length and pound and ton to measure
weight. For capacity, the units used are cup, pint, quart and gallons. Both the U.S. system and the metric system measure
time in seconds, minutes, or hours.
The equivalencies among the basic units of the U.S. system of measurement are listed in Table 7.2. The table also shows,
in parentheses, the common abbreviations for each measurement.

In many real-life applications, we need to convert between units of measurement. We will use the identity property of
multiplication to do these conversions. We’ll restate the Identity Property of Multiplication here for easy reference.

For any real number a,
To use the identity property of multiplication, we write

1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so we can write 1 as the fraction

1 ft . When we multiply by this fraction, we do not change the value but just change the units.
12 in

12 in also equals 1. How do we decide whether to multiply by 1 ft or 12 in ? We choose the fraction that will

Since the metric system is based on multiples of ten, conversions involve multiplying by multiples of ten. In Decimal
Operations, we learned how to simplify these calculations by just moving the decimal.

10, 100, or 1000, we move the decimal to the right 1, 2, or 3 places, respectively. To multiply by
0.1, 0.01, or 0.001 we move the decimal to the left 1, 2, or 3 places respectively.

To multiply by

We can apply this pattern when we make measurement conversions in the metric system.

3200 grams to kilograms by multiplying by

1 (or 0.001). This is the same as moving

Use Mixed Units of Measurement in the Metric System
Performing arithmetic operations on measurements with mixed units of measures in the metric system requires the same
care we used in the U.S. system. But it may be easier because of the relation of the units to the powers of 10. We still

Chapter 7 The Properties of Real Numbers

If we know the temperature in one system, we can use a formula to convert it to the other system.
Temperature Conversion
To convert from Fahrenheit temperature,

F, to Celsius temperature, C, use the formula
C = 5 (F − 32)
9

To convert from Celsius temperature,

C, to Fahrenheit temperature, F, use the formula
F = 9 C + 32

Solution
We will substitute

50°F into the formula to find C.

Use the formula for converting °F to °C

C = 5 (F − 32)
9

Simplify in parentheses.

C = 5 (18)

Chapter 8 Solving Linear Equations

We are now ready to “get to the good stuff.” You have the basics down and are ready to begin one of the most important
topics in algebra: solving equations. The applications are limitless and extend to all careers and fields. Also, the skills and
techniques you learn here will help improve your critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This is a great benefit of
studying mathematics and will be useful in your life in ways you may not see right now.

Solve Equations Using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality
We began our work solving equations in previous chapters. It has been a while since we have seen an equation, so we will
review some of the key concepts before we go any further.
We said that solving an equation is like discovering the answer to a puzzle. The purpose in solving an equation is to find
the value or values of the variable that make each side of the equation the same. Any value of the variable that makes the
equation true is called a solution to the equation. It is the answer to the puzzle.
Solution of an Equation
A solution of an equation is a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation.
In the earlier sections, we listed the steps to determine if a value is a solution. We restate them here.

HOW TO : : DETERMINE WHETHER A NUMBER IS A SOLUTION TO AN EQUATION.
Step 1.

Substitute the number for the variable in the equation.

Step 2.

Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation.

Step 3.

Determine whether the resulting equation is true.
◦ If it is true, the number is a solution.
◦ If it is not true, the number is not a solution.

EXAMPLE 8.1
Determine whether

y = 3 is a solution for 4y + 3 = 8y.
4

Solution

Multiply.
Add.
Since

y = 3 results in a true equation, 3 is a solution to the equation 4y + 3 = 8y.

We introduced the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality in Solving Equations Using the Subtraction and
Addition Properties of Equality. In that section, we modeled how these properties work and then applied them to solving
equations with whole numbers. We used these properties again each time we introduced a new system of numbers. Let’s
review those properties here.

Chapter 8 Solving Linear Equations

For all real numbers

665

a, b, and c, if a = b, then a − c = b − c.

Addition Property of Equality
For all real numbers

a, b, and c, if a = b, then a + c = b + c.

When you add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you still have equality.
We introduced the Subtraction Property of Equality earlier by modeling equations with envelopes and counters. Figure
8.2 models the equation x + 3 = 8.

Figure 8.2

The goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. So we ‘took away’
found the solution

x = 5.

3 from both sides of the equation and

Some people picture a balance scale, as in Figure 8.3, when they solve equations.

Figure 8.3

The quantities on both sides of the equal sign in an equation are equal, or balanced. Just as with the balance scale,
whatever you do to one side of the equation you must also do to the other to keep it balanced.
Let’s review how to use Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality to solve equations. We need to isolate the variable
on one side of the equation. And we check our solutions by substituting the value into the equation to make sure we have
a true statement.
EXAMPLE 8.2
Solve:

x + 11 = −3.

Solution
To isolate x, we undo the addition of 11 by using the Subtraction Property of Equality.

666

Chapter 8 Solving Linear Equations

Subtract 11 from each side to "undo" the addition.
Simplify.
Check:
Substitute x = −14 .

x = −14 makes x + 11 = −3 a true statement, we know that it is a solution to the equation.

Since

x + 9 = −7.

TRY IT : : 8.4

Solve:

x + 16 = −4.

In the original equation in the previous example, 11 was added to the x , so we subtracted 11 to ‘undo’ the addition. In
the next example, we will need to ‘undo’ subtraction by using the Addition Property of Equality.
EXAMPLE 8.3
Solve:

m + 4 = −5.

Solution

Subtract 4 from each side to "undo" the addition.
Simplify.

Substitute m = −9 .

The solution to m − 4 = −5 is m = −1 .

Chapter 8 Solving Linear Equations

Solve Equations That Need to Be Simplified
In the examples up to this point, we have been able to isolate the variable with just one operation. Many of the equations
we encounter in algebra will take more steps to solve. Usually, we will need to simplify one or both sides of an equation
before using the Subtraction or Addition Properties of Equality. You should always simplify as much as possible before
trying to isolate the variable.
EXAMPLE 8.6
Solve:

3x − 7 − 2x − 4 = 1.

Solution
The left side of the equation has an expression that we should simplify before trying to isolate the variable.

Solve Equations Using the Division and Multiplication Properties of Equality
We introduced the Multiplication and Division Properties of Equality in Solve Equations Using Integers; The Division
Property of Equality and Solve Equations with Fractions. We modeled how these properties worked using envelopes
and counters and then applied them to solving equations (See Solve Equations Using Integers; The Division Property
of Equality). We restate them again here as we prepare to use these properties again.
Division and Multiplication Properties of Equality
Division Property of Equality: For all real numbers

a, b, c, and c ≠ 0, if a = b, then ac = bc .

Multiplication Property of Equality: For all real numbers

a, b, c, if a = b, then ac = bc.

When you divide or multiply both sides of an equation by the same quantity, you still have equality.
Let’s review how these properties of equality can be applied in order to solve equations. Remember, the goal is to ‘undo’
the operation on the variable. In the example below the variable is multiplied by 4, so we will divide both sides by 4 to
‘undo’ the multiplication.
EXAMPLE 8.13
Solve:

4x = −28.

Solution
We use the Division Property of Equality to divide both sides by

4.

Solve equations using a general strategy

Solve an Equation with Constants on Both Sides
You may have noticed that in all the equations we have solved so far, all the variable terms were on only one side of the
equation with the constants on the other side. This does not happen all the time—so now we’ll see how to solve equations
where the variable terms and/or constant terms are on both sides of the equation.
Our strategy will involve choosing one side of the equation to be the variable side, and the other side of the equation
to be the constant side. Then, we will use the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality, step by step, to get all the
variable terms together on one side of the equation and the constant terms together on the other side.
By doing this, we will transform the equation that started with variables and constants on both sides into the form
ax = b. We already know how to solve equations of this form by using the Division or Multiplication Properties of
Equality.
EXAMPLE 8.20
Solve:

4x + 6 = −14.

Solution
In this equation, the variable is only on the left side. It makes sense to call the left side the variable side. Therefore, the
right side will be the constant side. We’ll write the labels above the equation to help us remember what goes where.

686

Chapter 8 Solving Linear Equations

the constant side. Since the left side is the variable side, the 7 is out of place. It is subtracted from the 2y, so to ‘undo’
subtraction, add

7 to both sides.

Solve an Equation with Variables on Both Sides
What if there are variables on both sides of the equation? We will start like we did above—choosing a variable side and a
constant side, and then use the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality to collect all variables on one side and all
constants on the other side. Remember, what you do to the left side of the equation, you must do to the right side too.
EXAMPLE 8.22
Solve:

5x = 4x + 7.

Solution
Here the variable,

x, is on both sides, but the constants appear only on the right side, so let’s make the right side the

“constant” side. Then the left side will be the “variable” side.

We don't want any variables on the right, so subtract the 4x .

EXAMPLE 8.26

We don't want variables on the right side—add 3n to both sides to leave only
constants on the right.

Note that we could have made the left side the variable side instead of the right side, but it would have led to a negative

Solve Equations Using a General Strategy
Each of the first few sections of this chapter has dealt with solving one specific form of a linear equation. It’s time now to
lay out an overall strategy that can be used to solve any linear equation. We call this the general strategy. Some equations
won’t require all the steps to solve, but many will. Simplifying each side of the equation as much as possible first makes
the rest of the steps easier.

HOW TO : : USE A GENERAL STRATEGY FOR SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS.
Step 1.

Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible. Use the Distributive Property to
remove any parentheses. Combine like terms.

Step 2.

Collect all the variable terms to one side of the equation. Use the Addition or Subtraction
Property of Equality.

Step 3.

Collect all the constant terms to the other side of the equation. Use the Addition or Subtraction
Property of Equality.

Step 4.

Make the coefficient of the variable term to equal to
Property of Equality. State the solution to the equation.

Step 5.

Check the solution. Substitute the solution into the original equation to make sure the result is
a true statement.

1. Use the Multiplication or Division

EXAMPLE 8.30
Solve:

3(x + 2) = 18.

Solution

Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible.
Use the Distributive Property.
Collect all variable terms on one side of the equation—all x s are already on the left
side.
Collect constant terms on the other side of the equation.
Subtract 6 from each side
Simplify.
Make the coefficient of the variable term equal to 1. Divide each side by 3.
Simplify.
Check: Let x = 4 .

This method worked fine, but many students don’t feel very confident when they see all those fractions. So we are going
to show an alternate method to solve equations with fractions. This alternate method eliminates the fractions.
We will apply the Multiplication Property of Equality and multiply both sides of an equation by the least common
denominator of all the fractions in the equation. The result of this operation will be a new equation, equivalent to the first,
but with no fractions. This process is called clearing the equation of fractions. Let’s solve the same equation again, but this

Solve Equations with Decimal Coefficients
Some equations have decimals in them. This kind of equation will occur when we solve problems dealing with money and
percent. But decimals are really another way to represent fractions. For example,

0.3 = 3 and 0.17 = 17 . So, when

Introduction
We are surrounded by all sorts of geometry. Architects use geometry to design buildings. Artists create vivid images out of
colorful geometric shapes. Street signs, automobiles, and product packaging all take advantage of geometric properties.
In this chapter, we will begin by considering a formal approach to solving problems and use it to solve a variety of
common problems, including making decisions about money. Then we will explore geometry and relate it to everyday
situations, using the problem-solving strategy we develop.

Approach Word Problems with a Positive Attitude
The world is full of word problems. How much money do I need to fill the car with gas? How much should I tip the server
at a restaurant? How many socks should I pack for vacation? How big a turkey do I need to buy for Thanksgiving dinner,
and what time do I need to put it in the oven? If my sister and I buy our mother a present, how much will each of us pay?
Now that we can solve equations, we are ready to apply our new skills to word problems. Do you know anyone who has
had negative experiences in the past with word problems? Have you ever had thoughts like the student in Figure 9.2?

Figure 9.2 Negative thoughts about word problems can be barriers to
success.

When we feel we have no control, and continue repeating negative thoughts, we set up barriers to success. We need to
calm our fears and change our negative feelings.
Start with a fresh slate and begin to think positive thoughts like the student in Figure 9.3. Read the positive thoughts and
say them out loud.

Figure 9.3 When it comes to word problems, a positive attitude is a big step
toward success.

If we take control and believe we can be successful, we will be able to master word problems.
Think of something that you can do now but couldn't do three years ago. Whether it's driving a car, snowboarding,
cooking a gourmet meal, or speaking a new language, you have been able to learn and master a new skill. Word problems
are no different. Even if you have struggled with word problems in the past, you have acquired many new math skills that
will help you succeed now!

Use a Problem-solving Strategy for Word Problems
In earlier chapters, you translated word phrases into algebraic expressions, using some basic mathematical vocabulary
and symbols. Since then you've increased your math vocabulary as you learned about more algebraic procedures, and
you've had more practice translating from words into algebra.
You have also translated word sentences into algebraic equations and solved some word problems. The word problems
applied math to everyday situations. You had to restate the situation in one sentence, assign a variable, and then write an
equation to solve. This method works as long as the situation is familiar to you and the math is not too complicated.
Now we'll develop a strategy you can use to solve any word problem. This strategy will help you become successful with
word problems. We'll demonstrate the strategy as we solve the following problem.
EXAMPLE 9.1
Pete bought a shirt on sale for

$18, which is one-half the original price. What was the original price of the shirt?

Solution
Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure you understand all the words and ideas. You may need to read the problem two or
more times. If there are words you don't understand, look them up in a dictionary or on the Internet.
• In this problem, do you understand what is being discussed? Do you understand every word?
Step 2. Identify what you are looking for. It's hard to find something if you are not sure what it is! Read the problem again
and look for words that tell you what you are looking for!
• In this problem, the words “what was the original price of the shirt” tell you that what you are looking for: the original
price of the shirt.
Step 3. Name what you are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. You can use any letter for the
variable, but it may help to choose one that helps you remember what it represents.
• Let

p = the original price of the shirt

Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may help to first restate the problem in one sentence, with all the important
information. Then translate the sentence into an equation.

722

Chapter 9 Math Models and Geometry

Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Even if you know the answer right away, using algebra will
better prepare you to solve problems that do not have obvious answers.

Write the equation.
Multiply both sides by 2.
Simplify.
Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.

p = 36, which means the original price was $36. Does $36 make sense in the problem? Yes, because
18 is one-half of 36, and the shirt was on sale at half the original price.

• We found that

Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence.
• The problem asked “What was the original price of the shirt?” The answer to the question is: “The original price of the
shirt was $36.”
If this were a homework exercise, our work might look like this:

Problem-Solving Strategy
Step 1.

Read the word problem. Make sure you understand all the words and ideas. You may need to read the
problem two or more times. If there are words you don't understand, look them up in a dictionary or on the
internet.

Step 2.

Identify what you are looking for.

Step 3.

Name what you are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.

Step 5.

Solve the equation using good algebra techniques.

Step 6.

Check the answer in the problem. Make sure it makes sense.

Step 7.

Answer the question with a complete sentence.

Let's use this approach with another example.
EXAMPLE 9.2
Yash brought apples and bananas to a picnic. The number of apples was three more than twice the number of bananas.
Yash brought 11 apples to the picnic. How many bananas did he bring?

Solution
Step 1. Read the problem.
Step 2. Identify what you are looking for.

How many bananas did he bring?

Step 3. Name what you are looking for.
Choose a variable to represent the number of
bananas.

Let b = number of bananas

Step 4. Translate. Restate the problem in one
sentence with all the important information.
Translate into an equation.
Step 5. Solve the equation.
Subtract 3 from each side.
Simplify.
Divide each side by 2.
Simplify.
Step 6. Check: First, is our answer reasonable?
Yes, bringing four bananas to a picnic seems
reasonable. The problem says the number of
apples was three more than twice the number of
bananas. If there are four bananas, does that
make eleven apples? Twice 4 bananas is 8. Three
more than 8 is 11.
Step 7. Answer the question.

Yash brought 4 bananas to the picnic.

Solve Number Problems
Now we will translate and solve number problems. In number problems, you are given some clues about one or more
numbers, and you use these clues to build an equation. Number problems don't usually arise on an everyday basis, but
they provide a good introduction to practicing the Problem Solving Strategy. Remember to look for clue words such as
difference, of, and and.

Solve Coin Word Problems
Imagine taking a handful of coins from your pocket or purse and placing them on your desk. How would you determine
the value of that pile of coins?
If you can form a step-by-step plan for finding the total value of the coins, it will help you as you begin solving coin word
problems.
One way to bring some order to the mess of coins would be to separate the coins into stacks according to their value.
Quarters would go with quarters, dimes with dimes, nickels with nickels, and so on. To get the total value of all the coins,
you would add the total value of each pile.

Figure 9.4 To determine the total value of a stack of nickels, multiply
the number of nickels times the value of one nickel.(Credit: Darren
Hester via ppdigital)

How would you determine the value of each pile? Think about the dime pile—how much is it worth? If you count the
number of dimes, you'll know how many you have—the number of dimes.

Chapter 9 Math Models and Geometry

735

17 dimes, how much are they worth? Each dime is
$0.10 —that is the value of one dime. To find the total value of the pile of 17 dimes, multiply 17 by $0.10 to get
$1.70. This is the total value of all 17 dimes.

But this does not tell you the value of all the dimes. Say you counted
worth

17 · $0.10 = $1.70
number · value = total value
Finding the Total Value for Coins of the Same Type
For coins of the same type, the total value can be found as follows:

number · value = total value
where number is the number of coins, value is the value of each coin, and total value is the total value of all the coins.
You could continue this process for each type of coin, and then you would know the total value of each type of coin. To
get the total value of all the coins, add the total value of each type of coin.
Let's look at a specific case. Suppose there are 14 quarters, 17 dimes, 21 nickels, and
to organize the information – the type of coin, the number of each, and the value.

39 pennies. We'll make a table

method is used to solve a coin word problem.
EXAMPLE 9.11
Adalberto has

$2.25 in dimes and nickels in his pocket. He has nine more nickels than dimes. How many of each type of

coin does he have?

Solution
Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure you understand all the words and ideas.
• Determine the types of coins involved.
Think about the strategy we used to find the value of the handful of coins. The first thing you need is to notice what types
of coins are involved. Adalberto has dimes and nickels.
• Create a table to organize the information.
◦ Label the columns ‘type’, ‘number’, ‘value’, ‘total value’.
◦ List the types of coins.
◦ Write in the value of each type of coin.
◦ Write in the total value of all the coins.
We can work this problem all in cents or in dollars. Here we will do it in dollars and put in the dollar sign ($) in the table as
a reminder.
The value of a dime is

$0.10 and the value of a nickel is $0.05. The total value of all the coins is $2.25.

Step 2. Identify what you are looking for.
• We are asked to find the number of dimes and nickels Adalberto has.
Step 3. Name what you are looking for.
• Use variable expressions to represent the number of each type of coin.
• Multiply the number times the value to get the total value of each type of coin.
In this problem you cannot count each type of coin—that is what you are looking for—but you have a clue. There
are nine more nickels than dimes. The number of nickels is nine more than the number of dimes.

Let d = number of dimes.
d + 9 = number of nickels

number, you do have an expression to represent it.
And so now multiply

Danny has

$2.14 worth of pennies and nickels in his piggy bank. The number of nickels is two more than ten times the

number of pennies. How many nickels and how many pennies does Danny have?

Solution
Step 1: Read the problem.
Determine the types of coins involved.
Create a table.

Pennies and nickels
Pennies are worth $0.01.

Write in the value of each type of coin.

Nickels are worth $0.05.

Step 2: Identify what you are looking for.

the number of pennies and
nickels

Step 3: Name. Represent the number of each type of coin using variables.
The number of nickels is defined in terms of the number of pennies, so
start with pennies.

Let p = number of pennies

The number of nickels is two more than then times the number of pennies.

10p + 2 = number of nickels

Solve Ticket and Stamp Word Problems
The strategies we used for coin problems can be easily applied to some other kinds of problems too. Problems involving
tickets or stamps are very similar to coin problems, for example. Like coins, tickets and stamps have different values; so
we can organize the information in tables much like we did for coin problems.
EXAMPLE 9.14
At a school concert, the total value of tickets sold was

$1,506. Student tickets sold for $6 each and adult tickets sold for

$9 each. The number of adult tickets sold was 5 less than three times the number of student tickets sold. How many

student tickets and how many adult tickets were sold?

Solution
Step 1: Read the problem.
• Determine the types of tickets involved.
There are student tickets and adult tickets.
• Create a table to organize the information.

Step 2. Identify what you are looking for.

We are looking for the number of student and adult tickets.
Step 3. Name. Represent the number of each type of ticket using variables.

We know the number of adult tickets sold was 5 less than three times the number of student tickets sold.
Let s be the number of student tickets.
Then 3s − 5 is the number of adult tickets.
Multiply the number times the value to get the total value of each type of ticket.

Step 5. Solve the equation.

6s + 27s − 45 = 1506
33s − 45 = 1506
33s = 1551
s = 47 students
Substitute to find the number of adults.

Step 6. Check. There were

47 student tickets at $6 each and 136 adult tickets at $9 each. Is the total value $1506 ?

We find the total value of each type of ticket by multiplying the number of tickets times its value; we then add to get the
total value of all the tickets sold.

47 · 6 = 282
136 · 9 = _____

An angle is formed by two rays that share a common endpoint. Each ray is called a side of the angle and the common
endpoint is called the vertex. An angle is named by its vertex. In Figure 9.6, ∠A is the angle with vertex at point A. The

vertices. The triangle in Figure 9.9 is called ΔABC, read ‘triangle ABC ’. We label each side with a lower case letter to
match the upper case letter of the opposite vertex.

Similar Triangles
When we use a map to plan a trip, a sketch to build a bookcase, or a pattern to sew a dress, we are working with similar
figures. In geometry, if two figures have exactly the same shape but different sizes, we say they are similar figures. One
is a scale model of the other. The corresponding sides of the two figures have the same ratio, and all their corresponding
angles are have the same measures.

ΔABC is four times the length of the corresponding side of
ΔXYZ and their corresponding angles have equal measures.

The two triangles in Figure 9.11 are similar. Each side of

Figure 9.11 ΔABC and ΔXYZ are similar triangles. Their
corresponding sides have the same ratio and the corresponding
angles have the same measure.

Properties of Similar Triangles
If two triangles are similar, then their corresponding angle measures are equal and their corresponding side lengths
are in the same ratio.

The length of a side of a triangle may be referred to by its endpoints, two vertices of the triangle. For example, in

ΔABC:

the length a can also be written BC
the length b can also be written AC
the length c can also be written AB
We will often use this notation when we solve similar triangles because it will help us match up the corresponding side
lengths.
EXAMPLE 9.21

ΔABC and ΔXYZ are similar triangles. The lengths of two sides of each triangle are shown. Find the lengths of the
third side of each triangle.

ΔABC is similar to ΔXYZ. Find y.

Use the Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean Theorem is a special property of right triangles that has been used since ancient times. It is named
after the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras who lived around 500 BCE.
Remember that a right triangle has a
triangle opposite the

90° angle, which we usually mark with a small square in the corner. The side of the

90° angle is called the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called the legs. See Figure 9.12.

Figure 9.12 In a right triangle, the side opposite the 90° angle is called
the hypotenuse and each of the other sides is called a leg.

The Pythagorean Theorem tells how the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle relate to each other. It states that in
any right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs equals the square of the hypotenuse.
The Pythagorean Theorem
In any right triangle

ΔABC,
a2 + b2 = c2

where

c is the length of the hypotenuse a and b are the lengths of the legs.

To solve problems that use the Pythagorean Theorem, we will need to find square roots. In Simplify and Use Square
Roots we introduced the notation m and defined it in this way:

If m = n 2, then m = n for n ≥ 0
For example, we found that

25 is 5 because 5 2 = 25.

We will use this definition of square roots to solve for the length of a side in a right triangle.

Understand Linear, Square, and Cubic Measure
When you measure your height or the length of a garden hose, you use a ruler or tape measure (Figure 9.13). A tape
measure might remind you of a line—you use it for linear measure, which measures length. Inch, foot, yard, mile,
centimeter and meter are units of linear measure.

Figure 9.13 This tape measure measures inches along the top and centimeters along the
bottom.

When you want to know how much tile is needed to cover a floor, or the size of a wall to be painted, you need to know the
area, a measure of the region needed to cover a surface. Area is measured is square units. We often use square inches,
square feet, square centimeters, or square miles to measure area. A square centimeter is a square that is one centimeter
(cm) on each side. A square inch is a square that is one inch on each side (Figure 9.14).

Figure 9.14 Square measures have sides that are each

1

unit in length.

2 feet long by 3 feet wide. Each square is 1 foot wide by 1 foot long, or 1
6 squares. The area of the rug is 6 square feet.

Figure 9.15 shows a rectangular rug that is
square foot. The rug is made of

Figure 9.15 The rug contains six squares of
1 square foot each, so the total area of the
rug is 6 square feet.

When you measure how much it takes to fill a container, such as the amount of gasoline that can fit in a tank, or the
amount of medicine in a syringe, you are measuring volume. Volume is measured in cubic units such as cubic inches or
cubic centimeters. When measuring the volume of a rectangular solid, you measure how many cubes fill the container.
We often use cubic centimeters, cubic inches, and cubic feet. A cubic centimeter is a cube that measures one centimeter
on each side, while a cubic inch is a cube that measures one inch on each side (Figure 9.16).

Figure 9.16 Cubic measures have sides
that are 1 unit in length.

3 inches on each side and is cut on the lines shown. How many little cubes
does it contain? If we were to take the big cube apart, we would find 27 little cubes, with each one measuring one inch
on all sides. So each little cube has a volume of 1 cubic inch, and the volume of the big cube is 27 cubic inches.
Suppose the cube in Figure 9.17 measures

Figure 9.17 A cube that measures 3 inches
on each side is made up of 27 one-inch
cubes, or 27 cubic inches.

Many geometry applications will involve finding the perimeter or the area of a figure. There are also many applications of
perimeter and area in everyday life, so it is important to make sure you understand what they each mean.
Picture a room that needs new floor tiles. The tiles come in squares that are a foot on each side—one square foot. How
many of those squares are needed to cover the floor? This is the area of the floor.
Next, think about putting new baseboard around the room, once the tiles have been laid. To figure out how many strips
are needed, you must know the distance around the room. You would use a tape measure to measure the number of feet
around the room. This distance is the perimeter.
Perimeter and Area
The perimeter is a measure of the distance around a figure.
The area is a measure of the surface covered by a figure.
Figure 9.18 shows a square tile that is 1 inch on each side. If an ant walked around the edge of the tile, it would walk
inches. This distance is the perimeter of the tile.

Since the tile is a square that is 1 inch on each side, its area is one square inch. The area of a shape is measured by
determining how many square units cover the shape.

Use the Properties of Rectangles
A rectangle has four sides and four right angles. The opposite sides of a rectangle are the same length. We refer to one
side of the rectangle as the length, L, and the adjacent side as the width, W. See Figure 9.19.

Figure 9.19 A rectangle has four sides, and
four right angles. The sides are labeled L for
length and W for width.

The perimeter,

P, of the rectangle is the distance around the rectangle. If you started at one corner and walked around
L + W + L + W units, or two lengths and two widths. The perimeter then is

the rectangle, you would walk

P=L+W +L+W
or
P = 2L + 2W
2 feet
3 feet wide, and its area was 6 square feet. See Figure 9.20. Since A = 2 ⋅ 3, we see that the area, A, is the
length, L, times the width, W, so the area of a rectangle is A = L ⋅ W.
What about the area of a rectangle? Remember the rectangular rug from the beginning of this section. It was
long by

Figure 9.20 The area of this rectangular
rug is 6 square feet, its length times its

Properties of Rectangles
• Rectangles have four sides and four right

(90°) angles.

• The lengths of opposite sides are equal.
• The perimeter,
• The area,

P, of a rectangle is the sum of twice the length and twice the width. See Figure 9.19.

P = 2L + 2W
A, of a rectangle is the length times the width.

Use the Properties of Triangles
We now know how to find the area of a rectangle. We can use this fact to help us visualize the formula for the area of a
triangle. In the rectangle in Figure 9.20, we’ve labeled the length b and the width h, so it’s area is bh.

778

Chapter 9 Math Models and Geometry

Figure 9.21 The area of a rectangle is the
base, b, times the height, h.

We can divide this rectangle into two congruent triangles (Figure 9.22). Triangles that are congruent have identical side
lengths and angles, and so their areas are equal. The area of each triangle is one-half the area of the rectangle, or
This example helps us see why the formula for the area of a triangle is

A = 1 bh.

1 bh.
2

Figure 9.22 A rectangle can be divided into
two triangles of equal area. The area of
each triangle is one-half the area of the
rectangle.

The formula for the area of a triangle is

A = 1 bh, where b is the base and h is the height.
2

To find the area of the triangle, you need to know its base and height. The base is the length of one side of the triangle,
usually the side at the bottom. The height is the length of the line that connects the base to the opposite vertex, and
makes a 90° angle with the base. Figure 9.23 shows three triangles with the base and height of each marked.

Figure 9.23 The height

h

of a triangle is the length of a line segment that

connects the the base to the opposite vertex and makes a
the base.

Triangle Properties
For any triangle

ΔABC, the sum of the measures of the angles is 180°.
m∠A + m∠B + m∠C = 180°

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of the sides.

Isosceles and Equilateral Triangles
Besides the right triangle, some other triangles have special names. A triangle with two sides of equal length is called an
isosceles triangle. A triangle that has three sides of equal length is called an equilateral triangle. Figure 9.24 shows
both types of triangles.

Use the Properties of Trapezoids
A trapezoid is four-sided figure, a quadrilateral, with two sides that are parallel and two sides that are not. The parallel
sides are called the bases. We call the length of the smaller base b, and the length of the bigger base B. The height,

h, of a trapezoid is the distance between the two bases as shown in Figure 9.25.

Figure 9.25 A trapezoid has a larger base,
B, and a smaller base, b. The height h
is the distance between the bases.

Use the Properties of Circles
Do you remember the properties of circles from Decimals and Fractions Together? We’ll show them here again to refer
to as we use them to solve applications.
Properties of Circles

•

r is the length of the radius

796

Chapter 9 Math Models and Geometry

•

d is the length of the diameter

•

d = 2r

• Circumference is the perimeter of a circle. The formula for circumference is
• The formula for area of a circle is

C = 2πr
A = πr 2

π with 3.14 or 22 depending on whether the radius of the circle is given as a

decimal or a fraction. If you use the π key on your calculator to do the calculations in this section, your answers will be
slightly different from the answers shown. That is because the π key uses more than two decimal places.
Remember, that we approximate

EXAMPLE 9.41
A circular sandbox has a radius of

2.5 feet. Find the ⓐ circumference and ⓑ area of the sandbox.

Solution

ⓐ

Step 1. Read the problem. Draw the figure and label it with the given information.

Step 2. Identify what you are looking for.

the circumference
of the circle

Step 3. Name. Choose a variable to represent it.

Let c =
circumference of
the circle

Step 4. Translate.
Write the appropriate formula
Substitute

C=2πr
C = 2 π (2.5)

Step 5. Solve the equation.

C ≈ 2(3.14)(2.5)
C ≈ 15ft

Step 6. Check. Does this answer make sense?
Yes. If we draw a square around the circle, its sides would be 5 ft (twice the radius),
so its perimeter would be 20 ft. This is slightly more than the circle's
circumference, 15.7 ft.

Step 7. Answer the question.

Step 3. Name. Choose a variable to represent it.

Let A = the area of
the circle

Step 4. Translate.
Write the appropriate formula
Substitute

A = πr 2

A = π(2.5) 2
A ≈ (3.14)(2.5) 2
A ≈ 19.625 sq. ft

Step 5. Solve the equation.

Step 6. Check.

Yes. If we draw a square around the circle, its sides would be 5 ft, as shown in part ⓐ.
So the area of the square would be 25 sq. ft. This is slightly more than the circle's
area, 19.625 sq. ft.
The area of the
circle is 19.625
square feet.

Step 7. Answer the question.

4.5 feet. Find the ⓐ circumference and ⓑ area of the spa.

We usually see the formula for circumference in terms of the radius

r of the circle:

C = 2πr
But since the diameter of a circle is two times the radius, we could write the formula for the circumference in terms

Using the commutative property, we get
Then substituting d = 2r
So

C=2πr
C = π · 2r
C = π ·d
C= πd

We will use this form of the circumference when we’re given the length of the diameter instead of the radius.

Step 3. Name. Choose a variable to represent it.

Let c = the circumference of
the table

Step 4. Translate.
Write the appropriate formula for the situation.
Substitute.

C = πd
C = π(4)

Step 5. Solve the equation, using 3.14 for π.

C ≈ (3.14)(4)
C ≈ 12.56 feet

Step 6. Check: If we put a square around the circle, its side would be 4.
The perimeter would be 16. It makes sense that the circumference of the
circle, 12.56, is a little less than 16.

The diameter of the table is
12.56 square feet.

Find the Area of Irregular Figures
So far, we have found area for rectangles, triangles, trapezoids, and circles. An irregular figure is a figure that is not
a standard geometric shape. Its area cannot be calculated using any of the standard area formulas. But some irregular
figures are made up of two or more standard geometric shapes. To find the area of one of these irregular figures, we can
split it into figures whose formulas we know and then add the areas of the figures.
EXAMPLE 9.44
Find the area of the shaded region.

800

Chapter 9 Math Models and Geometry

Solution
The given figure is irregular, but we can break it into two rectangles. The area of the shaded region will be the sum of the
areas of both rectangles.

The blue rectangle has a width of

12 and a length of 4. The red rectangle has a width of 2, but its length is not labeled.

The right side of the figure is the length of the red rectangle plus the length of the blue rectangle. Since the right side of
the blue rectangle is 4 units long, the length of the red rectangle must be 6 units.

The area of the figure is

60 square units.

Is there another way to split this figure into two rectangles? Try it, and make sure you get the same area.

Solution
We can break this irregular figure into a triangle and rectangle. The area of the figure will be the sum of the areas of
triangle and rectangle.
The rectangle has a length of

8 units and a width of 4 units.

We need to find the base and height of the triangle.
Since both sides of the rectangle are
The length of the rectangle is

4, the vertical side of the triangle is 3 , which is 7 − 4 .

8, so the base of the triangle will be 3 , which is 8 − 4 .

Find Volume and Surface Area of Rectangular Solids
A cheerleading coach is having the squad paint wooden crates with the school colors to stand on at the games. (See
Figure 9.28). The amount of paint needed to cover the outside of each box is the surface area, a square measure of the
total area of all the sides. The amount of space inside the crate is the volume, a cubic measure.

808

Chapter 9 Math Models and Geometry

Figure 9.28 This wooden crate is in the shape of a
rectangular solid.

Each crate is in the shape of a rectangular solid. Its dimensions are the length, width, and height. The rectangular solid
shown in Figure 9.29 has length 4 units, width 2 units, and height 3 units. Can you tell how many cubic units there are
altogether? Let’s look layer by layer.

Figure 9.29 Breaking a rectangular solid into layers makes it easier
to visualize the number of cubic units it contains. This 4 by 2 by 3
rectangular solid has

24 cubic units. Notice that 24 is the length ×

width ×

height.

V, of any rectangular solid is the product of the length, width, and height.
V = LWH

We could also write the formula for volume of a rectangular solid in terms of the area of the base. The area of the base,
B, is equal to length×width.

B = L·W
We can substitute

B for L · W in the volume formula to get another form of the volume formula.

We now have another version of the volume formula for rectangular solids. Let’s see how this works with the
rectangular solid we started with. See Figure 9.29.

4×2×3

Figure 9.30

To find the surface area of a rectangular solid, think about finding the area of each of its faces. How many faces does the
rectangular solid above have? You can see three of them.

A front = L×W

A side = L×W

A top = L×W

A front = 12

A side = 6

A top = 8

A front = 4 · 3

A side = 2 · 3

A top = 4 · 2

Notice for each of the three faces you see, there is an identical opposite face that does not show.

S = (front + back)+(left side + right side) + (top + bottom)
S = (2 · front) + (2 · left side) + (2 · top)
S = 2 · 12 + 2 · 6 + 2 · 8
S = 24 + 12 + 16
S = 52 sq. units
The surface area

S of the rectangular solid shown in Figure 9.30 is 52 square units.

In general, to find the surface area of a rectangular solid, remember that each face is a rectangle, so its area is the product
of its length and its width (see Figure 9.31). Find the area of each face that you see and then multiply each area by two to
account for the face on the opposite side.

S = 2LH + 2LW + 2WH

Figure 9.31 For each face of the
rectangular solid facing you, there is
another face on the opposite side. There are
6 faces in all.

Find the Volume and Surface Area of a Cylinder
If you have ever seen a can of soda, you know what a cylinder looks like. A cylinder is a solid figure with two parallel circles
of the same size at the top and bottom. The top and bottom of a cylinder are called the bases. The height h of a cylinder
is the distance between the two bases. For all the cylinders we will work with here, the sides and the height,
perpendicular to the bases.

h , will be

Figure 9.32 A cylinder has two circular
bases of equal size. The height is the
distance between the bases.

Rectangular solids and cylinders are somewhat similar because they both have two bases and a height. The formula for
the volume of a rectangular solid, V = Bh , can also be used to find the volume of a cylinder.
For the rectangular solid, the area of the base,
area of the base,

B , is the area of the rectangular base, length × width. For a cylinder, the

B, is the area of its circular base, πr 2. Figure 9.33 compares how the formula V = Bh is used for

rectangular solids and cylinders.

Figure 9.33 Seeing how a cylinder is similar
to a rectangular solid may make it easier to
understand the formula for the volume of a
cylinder.

To understand the formula for the surface area of a cylinder, think of a can of vegetables. It has three surfaces: the top,
the bottom, and the piece that forms the sides of the can. If you carefully cut the label off the side of the can and unroll it,
you will see that it is a rectangle. See Figure 9.34.

Figure 9.34 By cutting and unrolling the label of a can of
vegetables, we can see that the surface of a cylinder is a
rectangle. The length of the rectangle is the circumference
of the cylinder’s base, and the width is the height of the
cylinder.

The distance around the edge of the can is the circumference of the cylinder’s base it is also the length

represented as

W of the rectangular label. So the area of the label can be

Find the Volume of Cones
The first image that many of us have when we hear the word ‘cone’ is an ice cream cone. There are many other
applications of cones (but most are not as tasty as ice cream cones). In this section, we will see how to find the volume of
a cone.
In geometry, a cone is a solid figure with one circular base and a vertex. The height of a cone is the distance between its
base and the vertex.The cones that we will look at in this section will always have the height perpendicular to the base.
See Figure 9.35.

Figure 9.35 The height of a cone is the
distance between its base and the vertex.

Earlier in this section, we saw that the volume of a cylinder is V = πr 2 h. We can think of a cone as part of a cylinder.
Figure 9.36 shows a cone placed inside a cylinder with the same height and same base. If we compare the volume of the
cone and the cylinder, we can see that the volume of the cone is less than that of the cylinder.

Figure 9.36 The volume of a cone is less
than the volume of a cylinder with the same
base and height.

In fact, the volume of a cone is exactly one-third of the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height. The volume
of a cone is

Since the base of a cone is a circle, we can substitute the formula of area of a circle,

Use the Distance, Rate, and Time Formula
One formula you’ll use often in algebra and in everyday life is the formula for distance traveled by an object moving at a
constant speed. The basic idea is probably already familiar to you. Do you know what distance you travel if you drove at
a steady rate of 60 miles per hour for 2 hours? (This might happen if you use your car’s cruise control while driving on
the Interstate.) If you said

120 miles, you already know how to use this formula!

The math to calculate the distance might look like this:

⎛

⎞

distance = ⎝60 miles ⎠(2 hours)
1 hour
distance = 120 miles
In general, the formula relating distance, rate, and time is

distance = rate · time
Distance, Rate and Time
For an object moving in at a uniform (constant) rate, the distance traveled, the elapsed time, and the rate are related
by the formula

d = rt
where

d = distance, r = rate, and t = time.

Notice that the units we used above for the rate were miles per hour, which we can write as a ratio
multiplied by the time, in hours, the common units ‘hour’ divided out. The answer was in miles.

Solve a Formula for a Specific Variable
In this chapter, you became familiar with some formulas used in geometry. Formulas are also very useful in the sciences
and social sciences—fields such as chemistry, physics, biology, psychology, sociology, and criminal justice. Healthcare
workers use formulas, too, even for something as routine as dispensing medicine. The widely used spreadsheet program
Microsoft ExcelTM relies on formulas to do its calculations. Many teachers use spreadsheets to apply formulas to compute
student grades. It is important to be familiar with formulas and be able to manipulate them easily.

d = rt. This formula gives the value of d when you substitute
in the values of r and t. But in Example 9.58, we had to find the value of t. We substituted in values of d and r and
then used algebra to solve to t. If you had to do this often, you might wonder why there isn’t a formula that gives the
value of t when you substitute in the values of d and r. We can get a formula like this by solving the formula d = rt
for t.
In Example 9.57 and Example 9.58, we used the formula

To solve a formula for a specific variable means to get that variable by itself with a coefficient of 1 on one side of the
equation and all the other variables and constants on the other side. We will call this solving an equation for a specific
variable in general. This process is also called solving a literal equation. The result is another formula, made up only of
variables. The formula contains letters, or literals.
Let’s try a few examples, starting with the distance, rate, and time formula we used above.

Identify Polynomials, Monomials, Binomials, and Trinomials
In Evaluate, Simplify, and Translate Expressions, you learned that a term is a constant or the product of a constant
and one or more variables. When it is of the form ax m, where a is a constant and m is a whole number, it is called a
monomial. A monomial, or a sum and/or difference of monomials, is called a polynomial.
Polynomials
polynomial—A monomial, or two or more monomials, combined by addition or subtraction
monomial—A polynomial with exactly one term
binomial— A polynomial with exactly two terms
trinomial—A polynomial with exactly three terms
Notice the roots:
• poly- means many
• mono- means one
• bi- means two
• tri- means three
Here are some examples of polynomials:

4y 2 − 7y + 2

5a 4 − 3a 3 + a

Notice that every monomial, binomial, and trinomial is also a polynomial. They are special members of the family of
polynomials and so they have special names. We use the words ‘monomial’, ‘binomial’, and ‘trinomial’ when referring to
these special polynomials and just call all the rest ‘polynomials’.

Determine the Degree of Polynomials
In this section, we will work with polynomials that have only one variable in each term. The degree of a polynomial and
the degree of its terms are determined by the exponents of the variable.
A monomial that has no variable, just a constant, is a special case. The degree of a constant is

0 —it has no variable.

Degree of a Polynomial
The degree of a term is the exponent of its variable.
The degree of a constant is

0.

The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of all its terms.
Let's see how this works by looking at several polynomials. We'll take it step by step, starting with monomials, and then
progressing to polynomials with more terms.
Remember: Any base written without an exponent has an implied exponent of

1.

Working with polynomials is easier when you list the terms in descending order of degrees. When a polynomial is written
this way, it is said to be in standard form. Look back at the polynomials in Example 10.2. Notice that they are all written
in standard form. Get in the habit of writing the term with the highest degree first.

Add and Subtract Monomials
In The Language of Algebra, you simplified expressions by combining like terms. Adding and subtracting monomials is
the same as combining like terms. Like terms must have the same variable with the same exponent. Recall that when
combining like terms only the coefficients are combined, never the exponents.
EXAMPLE 10.3
Add:

17x 2 + 6x 2.

Chapter 10 Polynomials

Solution
a 2 + 4b 2 − 7a 2
Combine like terms.
Remember,

−6a 2 and 4b 2 are not like terms. The variables are not the same.

TRY IT : : 10.10

Add:

Add and Subtract Polynomials
Adding and subtracting polynomials can be thought of as just adding and subtracting like terms. Look for like
terms—those with the same variables with the same exponent. The Commutative Property allows us to rearrange the
terms to put like terms together. It may also be helpful to underline, circle, or box like terms.
EXAMPLE 10.6
⎛

⎞

⎛

⎞

Find the sum: ⎝4x 2 − 5x + 1⎠ + ⎝3x 2 − 8x − 9⎠.

⎞

Parentheses are grouping symbols. When we add polynomials as we did in Example 10.6, we can rewrite the expression
without parentheses and then combine like terms. But when we subtract polynomials, we must be very careful with the
signs.

four factors of 2, so 2 4 means 2 · 2 · 2 · 2. This format is known as exponential notation.

Simplify Expressions Using the Product Property of Exponents
You have seen that when you combine like terms by adding and subtracting, you need to have the same base with the
same exponent. But when you multiply and divide, the exponents may be different, and sometimes the bases may be
different, too. We’ll derive the properties of exponents by looking for patterns in several examples. All the exponent
properties hold true for any real numbers, but right now we will only use whole number exponents.
First, we will look at an example that leads to the Product Property.

What does this mean?
How many factors altogether?

So, we have
Notice that 5 is the sum of the exponents, 2 and 3.

x2 ⋅ x3
x2 + 3

We write:

x5

The base stayed the same and we added the exponents. This leads to the Product Property for Exponents.
Product Property of Exponents
If

a is a real number and m, n are counting numbers, then
am · an = am + n

To multiply with like bases, add the exponents.
An example with numbers helps to verify this property.

Multiply a Binomial by a Binomial
Just like there are different ways to represent multiplication of numbers, there are several methods that can be used to
multiply a binomial times a binomial.

Using the Distributive Property
We will start by using the Distributive Property. Look again at Example 10.33.

We distributed the p to get
What if we have (x + 7) instead of p ?

Distribute (x + 7) .
Distribute again.

x 2 + 7x + 3x + 21

Combine like terms.

x 2 + 10x + 21

Notice that before combining like terms, we had four terms. We multiplied the two terms of the first binomial by the two
terms of the second binomial—four multiplications.
Be careful to distinguish between a sum and a product.

Sum
x+x
2x
combine like terms
EXAMPLE 10.34
Multiply:

(x + 6)(x + 8).

Product
x·x

add exponents of like bases

884

Chapter 10 Polynomials

Solution
(x + 6)(x + 8)

Distribute (x + 8) .
Distribute again.

x 2 + 8x + 6x + 48

Simplify.

x 2 + 14x + 48

TRY IT : : 10.67

Multiply:

(x + 8)(x + 9).

TRY IT : : 10.68

Multiply:

(a + 4)(a + 5).

Now we'll see how to multiply binomials where the variable has a coefficient.
EXAMPLE 10.35
Multiply:

(2x + 9)(3x + 4).

Solution
(2x + 9)(3x + 4)
Distribute. (3x + 4)
Distribute again.

Simplify.

TRY IT : : 10.69

Multiply:

(5x + 9)(4x + 3).

TRY IT : : 10.70

Multiply:

(10m + 9)(8m + 7).

In the previous examples, the binomials were sums. When there are differences, we pay special attention to make sure
the signs of the product are correct.
EXAMPLE 10.36
Multiply:

(4y + 3)(6y − 5).

TRY IT : : 10.72

Multiply:

Up to this point, the product of two binomials has been a trinomial. This is not always the case.
EXAMPLE 10.37

TRY IT : : 10.73

TRY IT : : 10.74

Multiply:

Using the FOIL Method
Remember that when you multiply a binomial by a binomial you get four terms. Sometimes you can combine like terms to
get a trinomial, but sometimes there are no like terms to combine. Let's look at the last example again and pay particular
attention to how we got the four terms.

(x + 2)(x − y)
2

x − xy + 2x − 2y
Where did the first term,
It is the product of

The next term,

x 2, come from?

x and x, the first terms in (x + 2) and (x − y).

−xy, is the product of x and − y, the two outer terms.

886

Chapter 10 Polynomials

The third term,

+2x, is the product of 2 and x, the two inner terms.

And the last term,

−2y, came from multiplying the two last terms.

We abbreviate “First, Outer, Inner, Last” as FOIL. The letters stand for ‘First, Outer, Inner, Last’. The word FOIL is easy to
remember and ensures we find all four products. We might say we use the FOIL method to multiply two binomials.

Let's look at

(x + 3)(x + 7) again. Now we will work through an example where we use the FOIL pattern to multiply two

binomials.

EXAMPLE 10.38
Multiply using the FOIL method:

(x + 6)(x + 9).

Solution
Step 1: Multiply the First terms.

Step 2: Multiply the Outer terms.
Step 3: Multiply the Inner terms.

Step 4: Multiply the Last terms.
Step 5: Combine like terms, when possible.

Using the Vertical Method
The FOIL method is usually the quickest method for multiplying two binomials, but it works only for binomials. You can
use the Distributive Property to find the product of any two polynomials. Another method that works for all polynomials
is the Vertical Method. It is very much like the method you use to multiply whole numbers. Look carefully at this example
of multiplying two-digit numbers.

You start by multiplying
Then you multiply

23 by 6 to get 138.

23 by 4, lining up the partial product in the correct columns.

Last, you add the partial products.
Now we'll apply this same method to multiply two binomials.
EXAMPLE 10.42
Multiply using the vertical method:

(5x − 1)(2x − 7).

Solution
It does not matter which binomial goes on the top. Line up the columns when you multiply as we did when we multiplied

23(46).

Multiply 2x − 7 by −1 .
Multiply 2x − 7 by 5x .
Add like terms.
Notice the partial products are the same as the terms in the FOIL method.

TRY IT : : 10.83

Multiply using the vertical method:

(4m − 9)(3m − 7).

TRY IT : : 10.84

Multiply using the vertical method:

(6n − 5)(7n − 2).

We have now used three methods for multiplying binomials. Be sure to practice each method, and try to decide which one
you prefer. The three methods are listed here to help you remember them.
Multiplying Two Binomials
To multiply binomials, use the:
• Distributive Property
• FOIL Method
• Vertical Method

890

Chapter 10 Polynomials

Remember, FOIL only works when multiplying two binomials.

Multiply a Trinomial by a Binomial
We have multiplied monomials by monomials, monomials by polynomials, and binomials by binomials. Now we're ready
to multiply a trinomial by a binomial. Remember, the FOIL method will not work in this case, but we can use either the
Distributive Property or the Vertical Method. We first look at an example using the Distributive Property.
EXAMPLE 10.43
Multiply using the Distributive Property:

(x + 3)(2x 2 − 5x + 8).

Solution

Distribute.
Multiply.

2x 3 − 5x 2 + 8x + 6x 2 − 15x + 24

Combine like terms.

2x 3 + x 2 − 7x + 24

TRY IT : : 10.85

Multiply using the Distributive Property:

(y − 1)(y 2 − 7y + 2).

TRY IT : : 10.86

Multiply using the Distributive Property:

(x + 2)(3x 2 − 4x + 5).

Now let's do this same multiplication using the Vertical Method.
EXAMPLE 10.44
Multiply using the Vertical Method:

(x + 3)(2x 2 − 5x + 8).

Solution
It is easier to put the polynomial with fewer terms on the bottom because we get fewer partial products this way.

Multiply (2x 2 − 5x + 8) by 3.
Multiply (2x 2 − 5x + 8) by x .
Add like terms.

TRY IT : : 10.87

Multiply using the Vertical Method:

(y − 1)(y 2 − 7y + 2).

TRY IT : : 10.88

Multiply using the Vertical Method:

(x + 2)(3x 2 − 4x + 5).

Simplify Expressions Using the Quotient Property of Exponents
Earlier in this chapter, we developed the properties of exponents for multiplication. We summarize these properties here.
Summary of Exponent Properties for Multiplication
If

a, b are real numbers and m, n are whole numbers, then
Product Property
Power Property
Product to a Power

am ⋅ an = am + n
(a m) n = a m ⋅ n
(ab) m = a m b m

Now we will look at the exponent properties for division. A quick memory refresher may help before we get started.
In Fractions you learned that fractions may be simplified by dividing out common factors from the numerator and
denominator using the Equivalent Fractions Property. This property will also help us work with algebraic fractions—which
are also quotients.
Equivalent Fractions Property
If

a, b, c are whole numbers where b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0, then
a = a · c and a · c = a
b b·c
b·c b

As before, we'll try to discover a property by looking at some examples.

Simplify Expressions with Zero Exponents
A special case of the Quotient Property is when the exponents of the numerator and denominator are equal, such as an
m
expression like a m . From earlier work with fractions, we know that

17 = 1
2=1

−43
x
In words, a number divided by itself is 1. So x = 1, for any x ( x ≠ 0 ), since any number divided by itself is 1.
The Quotient Property of Exponents shows us how to simplify
exponents. What if

m = n?

Now we will simplify
Consider first

a m when m > n and when n < m by subtracting
an

a m in two ways to lead us to the definition of the zero exponent.

Use the Definition of a Negative Exponent
The Quotient Property of Exponents, introduced in Divide Monomials, had two forms depending on whether the
exponent in the numerator or denominator was larger.
Quotient Property of Exponents
If

a is a real number, a ≠ 0, and m, n are whole numbers, then
a m = a m − n,
an

m>n

and

am = 1 ,
an an − m

What if we just subtract exponents, regardless of which is larger? Let’s consider

n>m

x5

We subtract the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the numerator.

Negative Exponent
If

n is a positive integer and a ≠ 0, then a −n = 1n .

The negative exponent tells us to re-write the expression by taking the reciprocal of the base and then changing the sign
of the exponent. Any expression that has negative exponents is not considered to be in simplest form. We will use the
definition of a negative exponent and other properties of exponents to write an expression with only positive exponents.

Convert from Decimal Notation to Scientific Notation
Remember working with place value for whole numbers and decimals? Our number system is based on powers of 10. We
use tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on. Our decimal numbers are also based on powers of tens—tenths, hundredths,

923

thousandths, and so on.
Consider the numbers
write the

4000 and 0.004. We know that 4000 means 4 × 1000 and 0.004 means 4 ×

1000 as a power of ten in exponential form, we can rewrite these numbers in this way:

When a number is written as a product of two numbers, where the first factor is a number greater than or equal to one
but less than 10, and the second factor is a power of 10 written in exponential form, it is said to be in scientific notation.
Scientific Notation
A number is expressed in scientific notation when it is of the form
a × 10 n
where

a ≥ 1 and a < 10 and n is an integer.

It is customary in scientific notation to use
in algebra.

× as the multiplication sign, even though we avoid using this sign elsewhere

Scientific notation is a useful way of writing very large or very small numbers. It is used often in the sciences to make
calculations easier.
If we look at what happened to the decimal point, we can see a method to easily convert from decimal notation to
scientific notation.

In both cases, the decimal was moved

3 places to get the first factor, 4, by itself.

• The power of

10 is positive when the number is larger than 1: 4000 = 4 × 10 3.

• The power of

10 is negative when the number is between 0 and 1: 0.004 = 4 × 10 −3.

EXAMPLE 10.74
Write

37,000 in scientific notation.

Solution
Step 1: Move the decimal point so that the first factor is greater

How can we convert from scientific notation to decimal form? Let’s look at two numbers written in scientific notation and
see.

91,200

9.12 × 10 −4
9.12 × 0.0001

If we look at the location of the decimal point, we can see an easy method to convert a number from scientific notation to
decimal form.

In both cases the decimal point moved 4 places. When the exponent was positive, the decimal moved to the right. When
the exponent was negative, the decimal point moved to the left.

Find the Greatest Common Factor of Two or More Expressions
Earlier we multiplied factors together to get a product. Now, we will be reversing this process; we will start with a product
and then break it down into its factors. Splitting a product into factors is called factoring.

In The Language of Algebra we factored numbers to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers.
Now we will factor expressions and find the greatest common factor of two or more expressions. The method we use is
similar to what we used to find the LCM.
Greatest Common Factor
The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more expressions is the largest expression that is a factor of all the
expressions.
First we will find the greatest common factor of two numbers.

Factor the Greatest Common Factor from a Polynomial
12 as
2 · 6 or 3 · 4), in algebra it can be useful to represent a polynomial in factored form. One way to do this is by finding the

Just like in arithmetic, where it is sometimes useful to represent a number in factored form (for example,

greatest common factor of all the terms. Remember that you can multiply a polynomial by a monomial as follows:

2⎛⎝ x + 7⎞⎠ factors
2·x + 2·7
2x + 14 product
Here, we will start with a product, like

2x + 14, and end with its factors, 2(x + 7). To do this we apply the Distributive

Property “in reverse”.
Distributive Property
If

a, b, c are real numbers, then
a(b + c) = ab + ac

and

ab + ac = a(b + c)

The form on the left is used to multiply. The form on the right is used to factor.
So how do we use the Distributive Property to factor a polynomial? We find the GCF of all the terms and write the
polynomial as a product!
EXAMPLE 10.84
Factor:

2x + 14.

Solution
Step 1: Find the GCF of all the terms of the
polynomial.

Find the GCF of 2x and 14.

Step 2: Rewrite each term as a product using the
GCF.

Rewrite 2x and 14 as products
of their GCF, 2.

2x = 2 ⋅ x
14 = 2 ⋅ 7

Step 3: Use the Distributive Property 'in reverse' to
factor the expression.

Introduction
Which cyclist will win the race? What will the winning time be? How many seconds will separate the winner from the
runner-up? One way to summarize the information from the race is by creating a graph. In this chapter, we will discuss
the basic concepts of graphing. The applications of graphing go far beyond races. They are used to present information
in almost every field, including healthcare, business, and entertainment.

Plot Points on a Rectangular Coordinate System
Many maps, such as the Campus Map shown in Figure 11.2, use a grid system to identify locations. Do you see the
numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 across the top and bottom of the map and the letters A, B, C, and D along the sides? Every
location on the map can be identified by a number and a letter.

For example, the Student Center is in section 2B. It is located in the grid section above the number
letter B. In which grid section is the Stadium? The Stadium is in section 4D.

Just as maps use a grid system to identify locations, a grid system is used in algebra to show a relationship between two
variables in a rectangular coordinate system. To create a rectangular coordinate system, start with a horizontal number
line. Show both positive and negative numbers as you did before, using a convenient scale unit. This horizontal number
line is called the x-axis.

x-axis at 0. Put the positive numbers above 0 and the negative
0. See Figure 11.3. This vertical line is called the y-axis.

Now, make a vertical number line passing through the
numbers below

Vertical grid lines pass through the integers marked on the
marked on the

x-axis. Horizontal grid lines pass through the integers

y-axis. The resulting grid is the rectangular coordinate system.

The rectangular coordinate system is also called the

x-y plane, the coordinate plane, or the Cartesian coordinate system

(since it was developed by a mathematician named René Descartes.)

Figure 11.3 The rectangular coordinate system.

The

x-axis and the y-axis form the rectangular coordinate system. These axes divide a plane into four areas, called

quadrants. The quadrants are identified by Roman numerals, beginning on the upper right and proceeding
counterclockwise. See Figure 11.4.

Figure 11.4 The four quadrants of the
rectangular coordinate system

In the rectangular coordinate system, every point is represented by an ordered pair. The first number in the ordered pair
is the x-coordinate of the point, and the second number is the y-coordinate of the point.
Ordered Pair
An ordered pair,

(x, y) gives the coordinates of a point in a rectangular coordinate system.
The first number is the x-coordinate.
The second number is the y-coordinate.

Identify Points on a Graph
In algebra, being able to identify the coordinates of a point shown on a graph is just as important as being able to plot
points. To identify the x-coordinate of a point on a graph, read the number on the x-axis directly above or below the point.
To identify the y-coordinate of a point, read the number on the y-axis directly to the left or right of the point. Remember,
to write the ordered pair using the correct order (x, y).
EXAMPLE 11.6
Name the ordered pair of each point shown:

Solution
−3 on the x-axis, so the x-coordinate of the point is −3. The point is to the left of 3 on the y-axis,
so the y-coordinate of the point is 3. The coordinates of the point are (−3, 3).
Point A is above

−1 on the x-axis, so the x-coordinate of the point is −1. The point is to the left of −3 on the
y-axis, so the y-coordinate of the point is −3. The coordinates of the point are (−1, −3).

Point B is below

2 on the x-axis, so the x-coordinate of the point is 2. The point is to the right of 4 on the y-axis,

Verify Solutions to an Equation in Two Variables
All the equations we solved so far have been equations with one variable. In almost every case, when we solved the
equation we got exactly one solution. The process of solving an equation ended with a statement such as x = 4. Then
we checked the solution by substituting back into the equation.
Here’s an example of a linear equation in one variable, and its one solution.

3x + 5 = 17
3x = 12
x=4
But equations can have more than one variable. Equations with two variables can be written in the general form
Ax + By = C. An equation of this form is called a linear equation in two variables.
Linear Equation
An equation of the form

Ax + By = C, where A and B are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two variables.

Notice that the word “line” is in linear.

Here is an example of a linear equation in two variables,

Is

x and y:

y = −5x + 1 a linear equation? It does not appear to be in the form Ax + By = C. But we could rewrite it in this

form.

Add 5x to both sides.
Simplify.
Use the Commutative Property to put it in Ax + By = C.

By rewriting

y = −5x + 1 as 5x + y = 1, we can see that it is a linear equation in two variables because it can be
Ax + By = C.

x, there is a
y value. This pair of values is a solution to the linear equation and is represented by the ordered pair
(x, y). When we substitute these values of x and y into the equation, the result is a true statement because the value

In the previous examples, we substituted the

x- and y-values of a given ordered pair to determine whether or not it was

a solution to a linear equation. But how do we find the ordered pairs if they are not given? One way is to choose a value
for x and then solve the equation for y. Or, choose a value for y and then solve for x.
We’ll start by looking at the solutions to the equation

To find a solution to a linear equation, we can choose any number we want to substitute into the equation for either

Solution
Step 1: Choose any value for one of
the variables in the equation.

We can substitute any value we want
for x or any value for y.
Let's pick x = 0.
What is the value of y if x = 0 ?

Step 2: Substitute that value into the
equation.
Solve for the other variable.

Substitute 0 for x.
Simplify.
Divide both sides by 2.

Step 3: Write the solution as an

Recognize the Relation Between the Solutions of an Equation and its Graph
In Use the Rectangular Coordinate System, we found a few solutions to the equation
the table below. So, the ordered pairs

3x + 2y = 6 . They are listed in

⎛
⎞
(0, 3) , (2, 0) , ⎝1, 3 ⎠ , (4, − 3) , are some solutions to the equation 3x + 2y = 6
2

. We can plot these solutions in the rectangular coordinate system as shown on the graph at right.

Notice how the points line up perfectly? We connect the points with a straight line to get the graph of the equation
3x + 2y = 6 . Notice the arrows on the ends of each side of the line. These arrows indicate the line continues.

Every point on the line is a solution of the equation. Also, every solution of this equation is a point on this line. Points not
on the line are not solutions!

( − 2, 6) is on the line shown in Figure 11.8. If you substitute x = − 2 and
y = 6 into the equation, you find that it is a solution to the equation.

Notice that the point whose coordinates are

Figure 11.8

So

(4, 1) is not a solution to the equation 3x + 2y = 6 . Therefore the point (4, 1) is not on the line.

This is an example of the saying,” A picture is worth a thousand words.” The line shows you all the solutions to the
equation. Every point on the line is a solution of the equation. And, every solution of this equation is on this line. This line
is called the graph of the equation 3x + 2y = 6 .

Graph a Linear Equation by Plotting Points
There are several methods that can be used to graph a linear equation. The method we used at the start of this section to
graph is called plotting points, or the Point-Plotting Method.
Let’s graph the equation

y = 2x + 1 by plotting points.

We start by finding three points that are solutions to the equation. We can choose any value for

x or y, and then solve

for the other variable.

y is isolated on the left side of the equation, it is easier to choose values for x. We will use 0, 1, and -2 for x
for this example. We substitute each value of x into the equation and solve for y.
Since

We can organize the solutions in a table. See Table 11.2.

Now we plot the points on a rectangular coordinate system. Check that the points line up. If they did not line up, it would
mean we made a mistake and should double-check all our work. See Figure 11.9.

Draw the line through the three points. Extend the line to fill the grid and put arrows on both ends of the line. The line is

HOW TO : : GRAPH A LINEAR EQUATION BY PLOTTING POINTS.
Step 1.

Find three points whose coordinates are solutions to the equation. Organize them in a table.

Step 2.

Plot the points on a rectangular coordinate system. Check that the points line up. If they do
not, carefully check your work.

Step 3.

Draw the line through the points. Extend the line to fill the grid and put arrows on both ends
of the line.

It is true that it only takes two points to determine a line, but it is a good habit to use three points. If you plot only two
points and one of them is incorrect, you can still draw a line but it will not represent the solutions to the equation. It will be
the wrong line. If you use three points, and one is incorrect, the points will not line up. This tells you something is wrong
and you need to check your work. See Figure 11.11.

Figure 11.11 Look at the difference between (a) and
(b). All three points in (a) line up so we can draw one
line through them. The three points in (b) do not line
up. We cannot draw a single straight line through all
three points.

Can we graph an equation with only one variable? Just

x and no y, or just y without an x ? How will we make a table

of values to get the points to plot?

x = −3. The equation says that x is always equal to −3, so its value does not depend on
y. No matter what y is, the value of x is always −3.

Let’s consider the equation

−3 for all the x values. Then choose any values for y. Since x does not depend
on y, you can chose any numbers you like. But to fit the size of our coordinate graph, we’ll use 1, 2, and 3 for the y

Identify the Intercepts on a Graph
Every linear equation has a unique line that represents all the solutions of the equation. When graphing a line by plotting
points, each person who graphs the line can choose any three points, so two people graphing the line might use different
sets of points.
At first glance, their two lines might appear different since they would have different points labeled. But if all the work
was done correctly, the lines will be exactly the same line. One way to recognize that they are indeed the same line is to
focus on where the line crosses the axes. Each of these points is called an intercept of the line.
Intercepts of a Line
Each of the points at which a line crosses the

x-axis and the y-axis is called an intercept of the line.

Let’s look at the graph of the lines shown in Figure 11.14.

Do you see a pattern?
For each row, the y- coordinate of the point where the line crosses the x- axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the
x- axis has the form (a, 0) ; and is called the x-intercept of the line. The x- intercept occurs when y is zero.
Now, let's look at the points where these lines cross the y-axis.

Graph a Line Using the Intercepts
To graph a linear equation by plotting points, you can use the intercepts as two of your three points. Find the two
intercepts, and then a third point to ensure accuracy, and draw the line. This method is often the quickest way to graph a
line.
EXAMPLE 11.26
Graph

−x + 2y = 6 using intercepts.

Solution
First, find the x-intercept. Let y = 0,
−x + 2y = 6
−x + 2(0) = 6
−x = 6
x = −6
The

x-intercept is (–6, 0).

Now find the

y-intercept. Let x = 0.

−x + 2y = 6
−0 + 2y = 6
2y = 6

The

What is it about the form of equation that can help us choose the most convenient method to graph its line?
Notice that in equations #1 and #2, y is isolated on one side of the equation, and its coefficient is 1. We found points by
substituting values for x on the right side of the equation and then simplifying to get the corresponding y- values.
Equations #3 and #4 each have just one variable. Remember, in this kind of equation the value of that one variable is
constant; it does not depend on the value of the other variable. Equations of this form have graphs that are vertical or
horizontal lines.
In equations #5 and #6, both x and y are on the same side of the equation. These two equations are of the form
Ax + By = C . We substituted y = 0 and x = 0 to find the x- and y- intercepts, and then found a third point by choosing
a value for x or y.
This leads to the following strategy for choosing the most convenient method to graph a line.

HOW TO : : CHOOSE THE MOST CONVENIENT METHOD TO GRAPH A LINE.

Solution

ⓐ y = −3

y. Its graph is a horizontal line crossing the y-axis at −3.

ⓑ 4x−6y = 12
This equation is of the form

Ax + By = C. Find the intercepts and one more point.

ⓒ x=2
There is only one variable,

x. The graph is a vertical line crossing the x-axis at 2.

ⓓ y = 25 x−1

As we’ve been graphing linear equations, we’ve seen that some lines slant up as they go from left to right and some lines
slant down. Some lines are very steep and some lines are flatter. What determines whether a line slants up or down, and
if its slant is steep or flat?
The steepness of the slant of a line is called the slope of the line. The concept of slope has many applications in the real
world. The pitch of a roof and the grade of a highway or wheelchair ramp are just some examples in which you literally
see slopes. And when you ride a bicycle, you feel the slope as you pump uphill or coast downhill.

Use Geoboards to Model Slope
In this section, we will explore the concepts of slope.
Using rubber bands on a geoboard gives a concrete way to model lines on a coordinate grid. By stretching a rubber band
between two pegs on a geoboard, we can discover how to find the slope of a line. And when you ride a bicycle, you feel
the slope as you pump uphill or coast downhill.
MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Exploring Slope" will help you develop a better understanding of the
slope of a line.
We’ll start by stretching a rubber band between two pegs to make a line as shown in Figure 11.17.

Figure 11.17

Does it look like a line?
Now we stretch one part of the rubber band straight up from the left peg and around a third peg to make the sides of a

90 ° angle around the third peg, so that one side is vertical

Figure 11.18

To find the slope of the line, we measure the distance along the vertical and horizontal legs of the triangle. The vertical
distance is called the rise and the horizontal distance is called the run, as shown in Figure 11.19.

To help remember the terms, it may help to think of the images shown in Figure 11.20.

2 units because the rubber band goes up 2 spaces on the vertical leg. See Figure 11.21.

What is the run? Be sure to count the spaces between the pegs rather than the pegs themselves! The rubber band goes
across 3 spaces on the horizontal leg, so the run is 3 units.

Slope of a line

When we work with geoboards, it is a good idea to get in the habit of starting at a peg on the left and connecting to a peg
to the right. Then we stretch the rubber band to form a right triangle.
If we start by going up the rise is positive, and if we stretch it down the rise is negative. We will count the run from left to
right, just like you read this paragraph, so the run will be positive.
Since the slope formula has rise over run, it may be easier to always count out the rise first and then the run.

Solution
Use the definition of slope.

Do you remember what was special about horizontal and vertical lines? Their equations had just one variable.

y = b; all the y -coordinates are the same.

x = a; all the x -coordinates are the same.

y = 4 ? One approach would be to graph the horizontal line, find two
points on it, and count the rise and the run. Let’s see what happens in Figure 11.24. We’ll use the two points (0, 4) and
(3, 4) to count the rise and run.

Quick Guide to the Slopes of Lines

Use the Slope Formula to find the Slope of a Line between Two Points
Sometimes we need to find the slope of a line between two points and we might not have a graph to count out the rise
and the run. We could plot the points on grid paper, then count out the rise and the run, but there is a way to find the
slope without graphing.

(x, y) gives
(x, y) be used

Before we get to it, we need to introduce some new algebraic notation. We have seen that an ordered pair
the coordinates of a point. But when we work with slopes, we use two points. How can the same symbol
to represent two different points?

Mathematicians use subscripts to distinguish between the points. A subscript is a small number written to the right of,
and a little lower than, a variable.
•

(x 1, y 1) read x sub 1, y sub 1

•

(x 2, y 2) read x sub 2, y sub 2

We will use

(x 1, y 1) to identify the first point and (x 2, y 2) to identify the second point. If we had more than two points,

we could use

(x 3, y 3), (x 4, y 4), and so on.

To see how the rise and run relate to the coordinates of the two points, let’s take another look at the slope of the line
between the points (2, 3) and (7, 6) in Figure 11.26.

Figure 11.26

Since we have two points, we will use subscript notation.

But 6 is the y -coordinate of the second point, y 2
and 3 is the y -coordinate of the first point y 1 .

So we can rewrite the rise using subscript notation.
Also 7 is the x -coordinate of the second point, x 2
and 2 is the x -coordinate of the first point x 2 .

So we rewrite the run using subscript notation.
